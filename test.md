She jumped off the ogre's corpse and began walking. After reaching a clearing, her eyes landed upon a dead wolf. A gray wolf, with its guts spilled, and its tail missing.

Josee walked over. She kneeled before the wolf. Her instincts telling her once more to douse it in fire.

And so she did.

The fire enveloped the dead wolf. It gently embraced it, like a mother caressing its child. Suddenly, Josee saw its body began regenerating, its organs and parts, slowly combining like a beautiful dance. It grew a tail, and its color changed to that of ash.

The fire then disappeared into its body, leaving cracks of fire and embers in its ashen body. And like a miracle, the wolf stood up. It struggled, and it fell down, but it stood up. Its eyes, matching that of Josee.

As if knowing it was her who saved it, the wolf lowered its head, licking Josee's hands.

Josee quietly stared at the wolf, her eyes widened in shock as to what her ability can do.

"... Oh, poor wolf", Josee spoke, her crimson eyes gently staring into the wolf's eyes.

"... You've been hurt have you not", she lightly smiled, "Fear not... I seek a companion. And you will do well. You will not be harmed, so long as you stay with me"

The wolf turned its eyes upward. Lowering its head and brushing its body towards her.

'... A weak wolf within this cursed forest... how unlikely', Josee thought.

"... I see... you wish to follow me. Very well. From now, you will be Frey", Josee gently petted the wolf's head before standing up. It growled a little and sat before her as if it was a dog.

It made Josee sport a smile.

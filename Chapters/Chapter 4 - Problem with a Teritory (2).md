Chapter 4  - Problem with a Territory (2)

Within the Lord's office of the Kalingrad Mansion, Josee sat with  six men standing in front of her.

"... Yes. I'll pay you each 10 silver after you've done this", Josee then dropped fifty silvers each for the carpenters and blacksmiths in her front.

""Woahh!""

"Milady, you're really serious?"

"... Yes. I will personally overseer this project. It's a new method of cultivating crops without soil"

After discussing much with the carpenters and blacksmiths, Josee ordered her steward, Alex, to open the storage house and give them the resources they needed. Though not a lot, it was sufficient.

'... By today, I'll have a few units where I can conduct experiment on which crop and nutrient combination is suitable'

After the men, Left, Josee called for Nadia.

"... Nadia", Josee softly asked, "I need you to order some men to get me these list of ingredients. Given them some bags of grain as reward"

"Milady", Nadia fixed her old glasses and read the words written on the paper.

"Animal manure, urine, compost, wood ash, bones, seashells, sand... mi-milady, what are these things for?"

"... Just an experiment"

"Oh... ", Nadia then remembered, "Is this for your academy milady?"

"... ", Josee paused for a moment.

'... Oh. Right.  I was on vacation during the 3rd year of my academy. I completely forgot', Josee thought.

"... No. It's for our people. I will show you once the ingredients are here"

"Ah, very well milady"

Finally dealing with the preparation, Josee rested her back on the chair.

"... Now then. I suppose I should stop just wildly flinging my sword"

Within the backyards of the Kalingrad mansion stood a man and a young woman.

"What?", Schulga stared in shock.

As usual, Schulga did his morning sword exercises. Wearing his tunic pants while topless, his well toned muscle breathed in and out.

His exercises were always commenced at the barracks courtyard just next to the Lord's mansion.

And standing before him was a woman with long brown hair, crimson eyes, white long sleeved shirt, and leather pants.

"… Teach me swordsmanship. Are you deaf?", Josee rolled her eyes.

"That…", Schulga frowned.

"… I want to learn swordsmanship. What else?", Josee then brandished her wooden sword. 

And the two stared at each other for a minute.

Schulga sighed, before raising his sword.

"… Very well, I shall teach you"

And so began their training process. Schulga started with teaching Josee the footwork. To which he was surprised at how fast she immediately learned them. Josee tripped and fell man times. Bruises started filling her body. But even then, she never gave up. Rising every time she falls.

They continued training from morning to night. And yet, it was Schulga who became exhausted and Josee still brimmed of energy.

A thing that Schulga can think must have been due to the fires which Josee displayed.

The Kingdom of Brytoria.

A powerful kingdom situated at the southern tip of the Continent of Eurasia.

Within the high walls of its capital city, a banquet is currently held at the King's palace. Nobles of high pedigree, wealthy merchants, high ranking members of the clergy, members of the mages tower and that of Knight's orders all mingled and interacted.

The grand banquet hall stood as a testament to opulence and power. Its walls were adorned with majestic tapestries, depicting mythic tales of valor. Above, a painted ceiling transformed the space into an open sky filled with celestial wonders. Gilded woodwork gleamed in the ambient light, and chandeliers of gold and crystal cast a soft radiance upon the tables. 

A symphony of curtains framed the towering windows, and marble sculptures graced the alcoves, their cold eyes bearing witness to the festivities. The table, resplendent with silver and exquisite tableware, beckoned guests to partake in a feast fit for kings. 

Nobles are resplendent in their medieval finery, donned in rich velvet tunics, embroidered cloaks, and glistening jewels, while knights and clergy wear suits of armor and holy vestments, their attire a tapestry of status and tradition.

In a corner of this banquet, a man dress in a humble blue noble tunic mingled among other nobles. He held a cup of wine and laughed together with them.

"So. With the war almost over, it presents us with a new opportunity"

"Indeed. The Montelar Kingdom is foolish to ever oppose us. With their kingdom occupied, there will be a great opportunity to establish new trade routes"

"Aight. Lord Edward, I believe the Montelar's great mines will be a better opportunity"

As the humble nobleman listened to his fellow nobles, he couldn't help but frown.

"Baron Kalingrad", spoke the deep voice of another noble man.

Baron Kalingrad turned around and smiled when he saw a middle-aged man with blonde hair in front of him.

"Ah, Viscount Montfort", Baron Kalingrad replied in delight, shaking the hands of the man in front of him.

"It's good to see you", the Viscount lightly smiled, "You should have sent me a mail on where you're staying, I would have dropped by!"

"Ah, I can't trouble you with that", the Viscount wryly laughed.

The two friends began talking and recollecting the old past. As the two remembered, they laughed at the many adventures they once had. Finally, Viscount Montfort paused, as if remembering something.

"Ah. Right. How is your daughter. Josephine?"

"... My daughter is doing well", Baron Kalingrad replied, "She's at home. Vacation from the academy"

"Hmm. Good. My daughter too. Did you know, reading fiction has been on the rage with youngsters these days", Viscount Montfort complained with a frown in his face.

"... They can't get anything done. Not even simple chores. It's corrupting them!"

"Oh. Fortunately, my daughter is not too addicted with those"

Their conversation continued. And as it did, Viscount Montfort suddenly spoke in whisper.

"Baron Kalingrad my friend, I know you've been looking for someone to invest in your territory", the Viscount dropped his shoulders.

"I am", the Baron sighed, "It's been a hard year. I've been diligent in my prayers, but it seems the gods do not look at me with favour"

Hearing the lament of his friend, the Viscount sighed. He placed his arm around Baron Kalingrad and pointed his hands to a man in another side of the room.

"Do you see that plump pi-, I mean wealthy man", the Viscount signaled with his chin.

"I believe that's the wealthy merchant, Sersious", the Baron Kalingrad caressed his goatee.

"What are you trying to propose, Viscount?"

"It's like this", the Viscount sighed, "Serisous is wants to be a noble. But he's only wealthy, there's no other significant accomplishment. Therefore... he's been looking for someone noble to"

"Marry", Baron Kalingrad cut him off with an almost hateful voice.

Hearing this, the Viscount sighed.

Baron Kalingrad immediately drank down all the wine in his cup.

"Haa... now what?", the Baron stared at the ground, "Am I to sell my daughter off now? Is that it?"

"Forgive me Baron, I did not mean offense", the Viscount explained, "It's simply an option. You know yourself, no noble would invest in Aquel"

"Tsk", the Baron scoffed off, "Do you even know the relevance of my territory. It was my ancestors who protected this Kingdom from the onslaught of monsters from the Cursed Forest. And now, now what? We're discarded when we no longer have any use!"

"I know, I know Baron", the Viscount turned his eyes around and hurriedly guided his friend away.

"You mustn't speak like that!", the Viscount felt the sweat fall off his forehead, "If others heard of you, you might get tried of treason!"

"Bah! To hell with that!", the Baron angrily protested.

Seeing that his friend's face was fully flushed, the Viscount sighed and simply brought him outside.


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


The Flames of Cinder arose once more.

Josee stood atop the body of a giant boar, almost the size of four men stacked on top of each other. The boar was filled with many cuts and slash, its body drowning from its own blood.

"... Now then", Josee jumped off the giant boar. Right now, she wore no armor, but a leather pants with a long sleeve. Her clothes were doused in blood and scratched and ripped in different places.

"I have to pull this thing but... ", Josee stared at the size of that monster and deeply sighed.

"... Strength training I suppose"

Suddenly, a wind passed her by, and Josee's sight of the world began shaking, her sight fell to the ground.

'... What', her eyes widened at the sight of her body falling before her.

'... Something beheaded me'

But the flames would not be stoked.

After she blacked out for a moment, Josee stood up once more, the Flames of Cinder resurrecting her. With her sharpened  eyes, she immediately saw a shadow walking over the tree branches.

A cat.

Josee touched her neck before glaring at the shadow cat within the trees.

"... What a terrible beast"

The cat glared at her, before a shadow energy grew from within its body, engulfing it.

Josee's eyes widened.

"... So It's a thing capable of magic"

Josee held her iron sword with both hands. As the cat hissed at her, it positioned itself and like lightning, leaped towards Josee with its terrible fangs.

But her iris's glowed a shade of red. The cat flew closer and closer. Three meters. Two meters. One meter. And just as it was near Josee's face, a flame suddenly enveloped her, catching the shadow cat off-guard.

"KRAHH!", the shadow cat growled.

Unable to react, Josee immediately grabbed its body and shoved a blade through its head, immediately killing the cat. The shadows within the beast immediately faded, turning in into a dark gray cat.

"... Hmm. Well that was anti-climactic", Josee threw the dead shadow cat on top of the freshly killed giant boar.

With ropes tied to the boar, Josee began her journey of pulling the beast back to Aquel.


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


The dawn slowly rose into the sky, blessing the humble village of Aquel a new day. But as the simple villagers  left their house in the early morning, they saw a fresh carcass of a giant boar in the village square. It was a boar as high as four adult men.

The villagers gathered together, their jaws wide opened, in awe of the sheer size of the fallen beast, but more so to the woman who sat on top of it. Her leather pants and white long sleeve were doused in dried blood, torn to many pieces.

Holding her sword, stabbed to the boar, she stared into the rising sun with such a peaceful gaze.

Moments later, a group of men arrived. A man in a priestly robe and a group of guards stood in front of the boar.

"Your ladyship!", the priest shouted. His brows were deeply furrowed, as a strange sight that shouldn't happen, occurred before him.

Hearing his voice, Josee lightly looked down.

"... What?", she softly, yet coldly replied.

"Umm", the 50-year-old priest, Father Pedran,  scratched his head, "Did you kill this boar?"

Hearing him, the villagers gasped. How could a fragile looking woman kill such a giant boar? It could easily tear apart twenty men with ease, the villagers thought.

"... I did", Josee replied without interest, returning her gaze back to the horizon.

Father Pedran widened his eyes. He turned to look at the surrounding guards, and they all shook their heads and shrugged their shoulders.

Suddenly, a man came running with a horse. He was still wearing his sleeping wear, as his muscles glittered from the sweat of the morning light.

"My lady!", Schulga shouted and went down the horse.

"W-What happened her- By the Divines!?", Schulga stared in shock. Seeing his noble lady's clothes in tatters once more, Schulga almost felt his heart pop out of his chest.

"M-My lady?! Are you alright?! My lady?!"

Schulga's shouting caused Josee to lose her momentary peace.

"My lady!!", he hysterically shouted.

A vein popped in her forehead, and not bearing to hear Schulga's shouting anymore, she furrowed her eyebrows and glared at him.

"... I'm alright! What are you, my mom?", Josee shouted in annoyance.

"Oh, I'm glad to hear", Schulga heaved a sigh of relief.

"Wait", the shock suddenly returned in Schulga's eyes, "Did you kill this thing?!"

"... Yes", Josee coldly replied, "Prepare it. We will have a feast"


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


After rinsing and changing to a humble beige dress, Josee went to a warehouse situated left of the mansion. It was a wooden warehouse with a stone base containing a wide and almost empty interiors.

In the center of the warehouse, a group of carpenters were busy cutting wooden planks. Others were using their tools and chisels to cut holes. As Josee walked inside, the four carpenters stopped their job and bowed.

"... Return to your work. At noon, go to the village center, there's free food"

Hearing the word free food, the carpenters, no older than 25 or 40, delightfully smiled and continued working.

Josee approached a table and saw bags after bags of sack. Standing beside the table was Alex, the new Kalingrad steward. He was wearing a humble tunic and vest while holding a parchment paper on his hand.

Seeing the table, Josee quickly opened each sack and saw the ingredients she needed.

"... seashells, ash, comfrey plant, seaweed, pig manure, soil... hmm"

Alex looked at the bunch of items in the table and couldn't help but cringe at the smell. However, seeing his lady showed no reaction, Alex couldn't help but keep his wit.

"... Alex, get me a bucket of water, also bring me five bowls, a mortar and pestle, a spoon, and as many buckets as you can get. Also..." 

Josee looked at the other sacks of bags and saw a bunch of crop produce.

"... Spinach, lettuce, onions, beans, cucumbers, mints and herbs... hmmm, there's not much variety, Alex, are there no potatoes?", Josee casually asked as she sorts through the crops taken from the Kalingrad storage bins.

"Err, potatoes?", Alex wryly smiled, "M-My lady, those things are new crops from the west, they're currently only grown in the richer territories"

"... I see. Well, it was tasty back in the academy. We'll grow it here", Josee coldly replied, coming up with an instant reason to cover up her lack of memory.

"H-How are we going to get them?", Alex asked.

"... We'll buy it", Josee then turned to him.

"... So, what are you waiting for?"

"Hm? Ah! Ah, yes!", realizing his mistake, Alex immediately ran away with lightning deft as if his life depended on it.

Josee returned her eyes back at the crops on the table.

'... Let's say I did succeed in scaling a hydroponics farm to support a village of 600 people. That still means in the foreseeable future, it would be unneeded once I obtain more arable land, or once I obtained access to the inner part of the Cursed forest and began mining'

After thinking for a moment, Josee shook her head.

"... No", her eyes determined.

'... If the memories of the chaos titans were to be believed, the first thing they did is pollute the sky and make it uninhabitable. Forcing people underground'

Moments later, Alex arrived bringing all the buckets, bowls, spoon, and mortar and pestle that Josee needed.

"... Good", Josee remarked.

'... If we are to be forced underground, I need to create a nuclear reactor. Or an alternative energy source. Then with a UV light technology, we can grow crops underground with Hydroponics'

And so, Josee began her experiment. She first took the seashells and began crushing them with the mortar and pestle. Josee realized that her physical strength itself has increased, allowing her to crush a kilogram of seashells in just a few moments.

After storing the seashells in a sack, Josee reached for a barrel in the warehouse and began slicing the seaweeds, grass, and other organic matter into tiny pieces before dumping them to a barrel. She then added the animal manure, and soil before mixing them with a stick.

"M-My lady, is it really necessary for you to do that dirty work?", Alex wryly asked at the side.

"... If you have nothing important, be silent", Josee reprimanded, causing Alex to immediately shut up.

After mixing them, Josee paused.

'... It'll take at least one month for this to decompose. Fortunately, a curse spell called decay exist. I just need to find that later'

"... Alex", Josee called over.

"Y-Yes milady!", Alex wryly smiled and stood behind her.

"... Gather some men and get as much manure, dead animals, eggshells, seaweeds, or any rotting organic material you can get and dump it in barrels. Make sure they slice it to tiny pieces first"

"Understood!"

Josee turned towards the table before stopping.

'... I have the basic ingredients here. But I've forgotten the ratios. Just have to experiment it'

Josee began mixing the crushed seashells, burned ash, and water. In 10 different buckets, Josee created 10 different mixtures of different ratios.

After finishing the mixtures, Josee covered them all with wooden plates before leaving the warehouse.

'... Now that that's prepared. All I need is to get the decay spell to decompose the compost. It's considered an illegal spell, but getting it from the black rats shouldn't prove difficult'

"... Now then, as for the cement", Josee walked outside the warehouse. Just east from there, a group of men is busy building a kiln made out of mud and bricks.

'... I'm certain I can burn enough temperature to create a primitive cement from combining limestone and clay. But for that to happen, I'll have to scout for an accessible cave rich in limestone. There should be a lot in this territory'


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


The afternoon sun began gracing the world with its orange light. The entire village of Aquel is in good spirits, as the village square of Aquel became filled with delight. The men, women, children, and old were busy dancing and cheering. 

In the center of the village, large metal woks were prepared, all of which contributed from each household, carrying stews of the giant boar that Josee slayed.

"Oh! Meat at last"

"Cheers!"

"Bless our lady!"

Josee watched from the top of the Kalingrad mansion. Wearing her plain white long dress, she quietly observed before turning back to her table.

On it was a single magic book. An old and dusty book that had signs of mites eating. After days of searching for it, her maids were finally able to find the old book in a forgotten chest on the cellar.

'_... No wonder  this family is on the decline_'

Flipping through it, Josee found herself able to read and understand the complex magical instructions written..

'_... This is single-handedly the most expensive thing in this household._'

"... Basic Magic Spells. Basic Mana Control. Levitation Charm, Light Spell, Aqua Orbis, Featherfall, Mend, Basic Elemental Manipulation (Fire, Water, Earth, Air), Charmed Wardrobe, Whispering Wind, Growth Spurt, Animal Friendship Glimmerglow, Shield of Reflection, and Refreshen"

Josee observed the spells written within the spell book. Her eyes widened at the possibilities, realizing that these things would no doubt revolutionize her methodical approach.

"... Well, it's a society ruled by the Holy Church, which states that god gave us the blessing of magic. And so, noble families base their value on their capacity to create mages"

More importantly, Josee found one special spell.

"... Growth spurt"

'... From my understanding, this spell only increases the rate of a plant's photosynthesis. The book says that a plant that takes one 6 months to grow will only take 3 months'

Josee stood up and walked across the room, towards the balcony. After picking up a pot of flower, she returned to her table and placed it there.

With her right-hand forward, Josee closed her eyes. She breathed in and about, feeling the flow of man within her heart. And as she did, she felt a circle flowing through her heart.

But it wasn't the circle described in the Basic Magic Spell book.

It was a burning fire circle.

Josee lightly opened her eyes, and a flaming magic circle appeared in her right hand. She rearranged the magic circle into exactly as the spell book needed. Suddenly, a bright light emerged, enveloping the plant as if it was burning.

And as the light faded, the plant grew taller and its flower grew larger.

"... Hmm...", Josee felt her mana decrease. But as she carefully inspected the plant, she noticed that the dark soil grew lighter.

"... Oh, I see", Josee remarked before casting the Growth spurt again.

After casting growth spurt three more times, the plant suddenly withered and died.

Josee saw that the soil became dried and completely cracked.

"... I see. It forces the nutrients from the soil to the plant, leaving the soil less healthy. I can see why even Josephine haven't heard of this used in a large scale. It'll kill your earth"

'_... But this is a surprise. If I were to use this on a large scale with hydroponics, it wouldn't kill the earth. The nutrient solution would be readily replaceable_'

"... Fascinating. A good coincidence Indeed", Josee lightly smiled.

Within her mind, ideas clashed one after another, promulgating the birth of a new technology only possible within this world. Josee took a piece of parchment and wrote her ideas down with such rapid pace that the writing became discernible only to her.

Standing up, Josee immediately rushed to the warehouse.

"... I need to test this"

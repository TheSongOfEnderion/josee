# Chapter 11 - Seed of Darkness

'... Well shit', Josee calmly walked towards the Pedonas Family's young daughter. The young girl face showed pain and sweat.

As Josee tightly grasped the violently wrigling dark hand and burned it, the scream from the small portal in her chest grew louder.

"Mi-Milady!", Schulga let out a smile of relief. But soon after his face broke into pain.

"L-Lady Josephine", Jorgen stared in horror as Josee casually walked, burning the shadowy entity in her hands.

Arriving next to the young mistress, Josee then casually pushed her hand into the portal, causing her hand to disappear inside. Seein this caused great alarm to everywhere, but they remained quiet, waiting for her decision.

'... Now then, show me what you really are'

The Flames of Cinder expanded, bringing light and warmth into a dark, shadowy dimension. But as the flames reached deeper, it suddenly ellumiated a collosal entity, quiety shivering and hiding in the dark.

A thousand arm, writhing and struggling all covered its mysterious body. An amalgamation of darkness and unknown aspects, it was a pulsing creature that feeds off the soul of its victim.

And the flames reached below, a certain anger emerged within Josee. A vision of a past from hundreds of thousands of years ago. Dark collosal entities that raomed the land, a slow and protracted genocide that ended all life.

And amidst those memories were entities being born from inside royalties.

Beings whose sole purpose were to open the gates for their arrival.

Traitors.

Backstabbers.

They were dark entities that took advantage of man's short life to hide themselves in the shadows.

We must kill them.

Kill them.

Destroy them.

Burn them to Ash!

We cannot let the past repeat itself.

You [############] must end the cycle.

Josee opened her eyes widely. Sweat poured from her forehead. From within the darkness inside the Pedonas Family's daughter, hundreds of shadowy spike came from the entity to the outside world, penetrating Josee's body a hundred times.

"Milady!", Schulga raised his sword. Pointed exactly at the young girl laying on the bend.

"No!!!", Jorgen stared in horror as he held Schulga's hands.

"By Ysmir!", Arina stared in shock as she began casting a magic in her hand.

But Flames of Cinder would not be stoked.

Josee's body burned brightly, causing intense heat in the room and forcing the three expectators to flee into a distance.

As the dark shadowy spikes burned, Josee's eyes sharpened. The Flames coalescend in her right hand, forming a sharp and thick spear of fire! Holding it with both hands, Josee penetrated the dark hole within the girl.

*KRAHGHGHHHFHF**

A shivering scream echoed through the mansion. Guards from every corner began rushing towards the room, as they felt danger arrive.

"... Block the entrance Jorgen!", Josee shouted. As Josee forced her Flame spear into the hole, a wringly mass of dark tentacles emerged.

Jorgen woke up from his shock as he heard Josee speak.

"... Stop anyone from coming to the room!", Josee fiercely glared at Jorgen.

But Jorgen remained frozen in shock.

"... Move your fuckign fat ass!", Josee angrily shouted, "If I can't concentrate in killing this thing, I'll kill your young lady so fucking do it!"

"Y-Yes!", Jorgen immediately left the room and blocked the door.

"... And bring me an oathmaker from the temple of death!", Josee shouted in annoyance.

"... Shit", she cursed.

'... I just wanted a damn boat, now i had to kill a relic of the chaos titans', Josee gnashed her teeth tightly.

'... To think they're actually hiding here. That means to get here, there must be some kind of gate that had to be opened from this side', but Josee immedaitely regained her calm. A dark shadowy spike suddenly slithered and aimed at her head. Pulling her left hand, she caught it and immediately burned it.

'... That changes things', a cruel glint of light emerged from her eyes, '... I need to find those gates and destroy it'

And with great vigor, as if the Flames of Cinder had its own life, the fire grew intensely and began burning everything inside the darkness.

Schulga watched in silence. The dark entity would try to release its hands or spikes to hurt his noble lady, and she she simply fling them away and burned them.

He turned to his left and saw the astonished mage, Arina, watched in silence.

"Tell me", Schulga asked, "Do you have any idea what's happening?"

"I... I don't know", Arina replied in dismay.

"I am aware of the Soul Arts and the curse on the young lady must definitely be because of that. But I have never heard of this kind of... thing. Maybe that entity is hiding in her soul"

"I see", Schulga frowned. He stared forward and saw a spike penetrated Josee's hands, but she merely shrugged it and the wounds burned away, healing her.

'I had already suspected it when I saw her in the Cursed Forest', Schulga watched in silence, 'But she really can heal almost instantaneously'

'So this is milady's powers...', Schulga turned his eyes downward, 'Maybe if she awakened much earlier. She could have saved her Mother'

'No', Schulga shook his head.

'Let's not get distracted'

Josee's battle continued with the dark entity. Her hand fully inside the dark portal in the young girl's chest. As the Flames of Cinder burned, it struggled and kept attacking her with rapid forces and strikes. But all were rendered useless against's Josee's healing. After a while, the flames fully devoured the dark entity until there was not even ashes left.

She calmly pulled her right hand out of the portal. As the last bits its existence disappeared, so did any remaints of the darkness.

Josee stood calmly. Her clothes were tattered and filled with a lot of holes. Suddenly, she felt a warm hand on her shoulder, placing a robe over her body.

"Milady, are you alright?", Schulga asked with a worried frown as he covered her with a red coat he borrowed from Arina.

"... I am fine", Josee replied while flicking her hair.

"Me... Melisia?", a quivering voice caught her attention. A man in an opulet red suit slowly approached the bed. Josee turned towards it and saw the young girl slowly opening her eyes.

Quickly, the man sat besides her, and the girl grew more cognizant.

"F-Father?", Melisia spoke with a hoarse, thirsted voice.

"M-Melisa... you're awake. You're awake!", the man in an opulent red suit could no longer take it and cried, hugging his daughter tightly with his hands.

Josee turned around and saw the shocked expression of everyone in the room. Jorgen stood there with wide eyes whilst Arina slowly approached with her hands in her chest. A few guards were peeking from the door.

Suddenly from the door, a group of maids pushed through carrying a tray of soup, water, and towels.

"Thank you. I am truly grateful", Jorgen approached Josee. Seeing his young lady finally wake up, the fat bellied steward could help but feel teary.

"... Ok", Josee noted. She turned to the back and saw a man quietly standing with blind folded eyes. He was wearing a white robe, almost too white. besides him was a young boy who was holding his hands, no older than 12.

Josee walked behind the crying  man by the bed and spoke.

"... You can cry later, we have business. immedaitely", Josee coldly ordered. 

Feeling her sudden rude remark, some of the guards became riled up and even Jorgen frowned.

"Lady Josephine", jorgen stepped forward, "The Lord is currently at a sensitive moment, please, let us deal with this late-"

"... No", she replied..

"... And you're an incompetent steward", Josee glared with fierce, almost violent eyes that made Jorgen shiver.

"... I had asked you to block off entry from the door...", a vein popped in her forehead, "... and now everyone in the fucking world sees what happened here. Did you even use your brain? Look at your servants and guards peeking through like it's a fucking amusement park? Are you retarded you piece of shit?"

"Argh!!", Jorgen finally realized his mistake. In the heat of the moment and his flush of emotion, he had forgotten his duties.

Naturally, he understood why Josee wanted to keep things here a secret.

"She's right Jorgen", the mayor stood up, wiping the tears from his eyes. He was a rich-looking man with a clean side-parted blonde hair and green eyes.

"Everyone, dismi-", but as he spoke, Josee cut him off.

"...No", Josee interrupted.

"... Gather every servant in the mansion, and even any servant from outside nearby and have them swear an oath with the Oathmaker from the temple of death. To not speak in anyway of the even that happened here unless i permitted it"

Josee turned to face the mayor with firm eyes.

"Hmmm", the mayor silently groaned, "And if I refuse?"

"... I will massacre everyone in this mansion"

"Very well", Erik sighed. But deep inside, his back was sweating.

He had seen what happened. A shadowy entity had taken hold of his daughter. As the mayor of the free city, he was well versed in the world of magic as he had to deal with it in great importance. Jorgen had filled him up with what had happen at first and he came to a conclusion.

Almost very few people would have been able to do what Josee just did. 

They say powerful beings all had a screw loose in their heads, because they have the rights to do so.

'She reminds me of the Master of the Golden Tower', Erik grit his teeth inwardly.

That's why when Josee threated to massacre them, he dare not take it seriously.

"Gather everyone in this mansion and have them make an oath. No one shall be left behind!"

◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

Within the private lobby room of the Pedonas family mansion where they put their most esteemed guest, Josee sat quietly at the soft and nice sofa, drinking tea while Schulga was merely quiet, standing up behind her.

An hour passed and all servants within the Pedonas Family's grounds were all made to swore before the God of Death.

The Oath of Death. It was the heaviest oath where any transgression would result in an immediate death, and only a Sacramented Blind Priest would have the right to do so.

Josee remembered the temple of the God of Death. But it wasn't used much in the novel. Unlike the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Moon, this temple was quiet and almost non-existent.

"... But death arrives at us all", Josee uttered with melancholy as she sipped the tea. Wearing a nice and simple red dress she asked from the servants, Josee felt refreshed after having a change of clothes.

Moments later, the door to the room opened, and a man with a clean shaven blonde hair and a black vest and suit walked inside the room. His expression carried relief, and yet his eyes were filled with confusion and worry.

Seating before Josee, he sighed deeply before staring straight at her.

"I apologize for making you wait. I had to settle a lot of things and made sure Melisia was safe", Erikur lightly bowed in apology. 

"... It doesn't matter", Josee simply yawned while carrying her teacup.

"Lady Josephine", Erikur spoke her name with a grave voice. Suddenly, he stood up, stepped forward and bowed ninety degrees in front of her. 

Seeing this, Schulga flinched. His eyes moved around, wondering if anyone is seeing this.

'... We entered here with brazeness and an hour and a half later the mayor is bowing', Schulga scratched his head.

'... Life is truly strange'

"I am sincerely expressing my utmost gratitude, Lady Josephine", his words carried a great weight, so much that it almost trembled.

But Josee only kept staring at him with her cold, indifferent eyes.

"What you have done to me. For my daugtherr. And for my late wife. We can never repay you"

But he was suddenly cut-off when Josee opened her mouth.

"... Ah, but you can repay me"

"Hmm?", Erikur lightly raised his eyes.

"... I didn't do this for your gratitude. I need material things. Pay it and we're even", Josee replied. Putting her cup of tea on the low table before pouring herself another cup.

"I see...", Erikur raised his eyes and stared deep into Josee's crimson eyes. The two made eye contact for a few seconds before erikur raised his body and sat on the sofa. He lightly smiled, almost gigling.

Erikur felt relieved. To him who had to deal with flatterer's, liers, and naysayyers on a daily basis, seeing a person honest with their feelings gave him a strange sense of relief.

'True, she is no saint. But that's exactly why that makes it better'

"Very well, tell me your wish"

"... But before we discuss my pay", Josee picked her cup of tea.

"... Ask your questions. I want to quickly get this over with so I can leave"

"Hmmm", Erikur fell into silence. True enough, he had a lot of things to ask. He clenched his fists resting on his legs before opening his mouth.

"so... What was that thing?", Erikur asked, his back straightened and his eyes stared with great fury.

"... Hmm. I dont know", Josee thought for a moment brfore replying.

"What?" Erikur raised his eyebrows. "How can you not know?"

"... It's.mroe like i'm not sure... I only have a vague idea""

"Then .. will you share that idea to me?"

"... Did your wife die a sudden death?"

"Yes", Erikur replied firmly. His hands clutching each other.

"Does my wife have to do with it?", he asked in a grave voice.

"... Well, let's just say this creature a parasite that predates on the soul of its user"

"What", Erikur's eyes widened. "H-How can such a creature exist? I've never heard of that!"

"... Of course you wouldn't", Josee rolled her eyes, "Shit, these things are older than these mountains and islands for all I care about"

"How is that-", Erikur's eyes widened.

To say something was older than the mountains and islands would only suggest one thing.

It was an entity so Ancient its origin could be that of this worlds beginning.

But how is such a thing possible?

But then again, it also made no sense that for a decade, no healer, not even a Paragon Healer could cure his daughter.

'Then... is she telling the truth?', Erikur gnashed his teeth, 'That enttiy is a Primordial Evil?'

"How did it... How did it get to my daughter?", turning his eyes downward, a great fury formed in his eyes.

"Did one of my enemies did it?"

"... Not quite, no", Josee replied, taking a sip from her tea.

"... You see, if I understand it right, your daughter would have woken up from her coma and 'liberated' from her curse all on its own"

"And why's that?", Erikur asked, staring straight to Josee.

"Because your daughter will grow up, find a man, fall in love.... And have children ", she uttered with a cold tone, "and it specially needs its host to have children"

Erikur's eyes widened. Josee's statement suddenly had a connection, a certain string of logic that made everything coherent.

"No... You're not saying.... That can't be!"

"... The host is not immortal", but Josee ignored the frustration of Erikur.

"... Eventually, it would deplete the soul of its host. By then it needs to transfer itself to another"

"No"

And Josee coldly continued, "That would be the child"

"NOO!!! ARFHHGHHH!", Erikur stood up and punched a vase near the window.

The sound of ceramic breaking was heard throughout the room. In this time, Schulga merely quietly watcked in sadness, empathizing with a broken man.

Erikur then kept breaking vases after vases until he breathed slowly. When he saw the glass stained windows, he began kicking them, breaking it to pieces.

"ARRGHHSHSH!!", the pain and agony emitted from him made the guards rush to the room. But Schulga quickly signalled to them to leave. Seeing the furious state of their master, they immedaitely shut the door off.

Erikur took his moment to calm himself before seating down and facing Josee, his hands bleeding.

Flicking her hands, Josees fire covered Erikur's fist wounds with Fire, gently healing them.

"Then...", his mouth shivered, "My wife... She.... This thing. It killed her"

"... Yes", Josee sipped her tea, "and it definitely killed her parents too. She should have told you what happened, right?"

"Indeed", tears fell down Erikurs eyes, "Her mother died a sudden death with no explanation. And so was her grandmother. Just like. Her"

"... So it would seem", Josee sipped her tea again.

"Hah.... Damnit. Damnit", Erikur gritted his teeth. He suddenly remembered all the people, all the men he tortured and all the groups he murdered.

"Then all my victims were innocent", Erikur gripped his hands tightly.

"They died of a sin they did not commit", his eyes widened from the madness. A realization of what he had done in pursuit of his vengeance and grief.

"... Well. We can't change those anymore", Josee dropped her tea.

A grieving father so loving that he'd do anything for his daughter.

Somehow Josee felt a hint of bitterness in her mouth. To see such a man cry reminder her of what she never had.

'... So this is what a Father and a Husband's love looks like', Josee lightly bit her lips.

Schulga quietly observed her. as he saw the frustrated look in her eyebrows, he couldn't help but sighed in relief.

'She always does that when she's facing difficuly. So... you really are my Lady Josee'

As Erikur let his tears go out, Josee and Schulga simply sat in silence. After a few minutes, Erikur finally calmed down.

"Forgive me", he took out a handkerchief and wiped the tears off his face.

After taking a few moments to breathe in and out, he looked at Josee with a calm face.

"That monster. I assume you have perfectly killed it"

"... I did", Josee nodded.

"Then, would there be more of them?", Erikur asked in a grave tone.

"... Most definitely"

"Then What is it's goal? It's purpose", Erikur tightened his hands, "I want to destroy every last one of them... Since only you has the power to do it, I will give you my full support"

Josee lightly closed her eyes.

The Pedonas family may seem like a mere small family that controls a city, but their history and connections runs deep into the world.

As the city that bridges two continents, they have contacts everywhere and they have access to information, artefacts, and wealth that runs deeper than the ocean. The same can be said with the other two families, but they're practically just a single clan anyway.

To receive the support of such a powerful clan would be greatly beneficial to Josee.

"... I can't tell you", Josee stared straight into his eyes, "It's too reckless to divulge such information at this time"

"Why?", Erikur grit his teeth, "Is my family, our family, not forbidible enough? Do you think we do not have the strength to defend ourselve-"

"... The waters runs deep, and the abyss should not be treaded", Josee cut him off.

"... You know what this ancient saying meant, right?", she answered coldly, facing Erikur's darkened expression.

Of course, Erikur knew what it meant. That one should not overstepped their boundaries and deal with things beyond their comprehenstion.

"Still... ", Erikur replied in anger, "You can't expect me to do nothing can't you? My wife was murdered. My family was almost ruined. I cannot sit idly by"

"... And For what? Hmm?", Josee harrumped in detestment.

"... Search for them? And then what? What I fought today was a seedling. But a seedling's goal is to mature. What happens if you got the attention of a fully matured one? Hmm? Fight it with useless magic? Shit, there's barely any soul arts user in this world, and I assure you none of them will lend you their strength. Not against facing ancient evils of unknown numbers"

Erikur's body grew cold. He felt his heart stabbed at Josee's words.

Schulga noticed the vein popping in Josee's forehead. At that moment, he realized she was truly irritated.

"... And what about your daughter? Hmm? She just got back the life stolen from her. She's barely 15 and still has a long life ahead of her. Are you going to throw that away in the name of vengeance for a dead person who would rather wish her daughter live a peaceful life? Did you even think of that you moron?"

As Josee continued her barrage of words, Erikur bit his lips. His heart thumped fast as the muscle in his neck grew tense. But as the indignance grew stronger in his heart, so did his love for his daughter.

None of Josee's words were wrong.

More than anything, his daughter was the most important thing to him right now.

"... Melisia needs her father", Josee continued in an irritated voice, "Not an avenger, but a loving father who will be there for her in her times of greatest need"

Erikur deeply inhaled. He sighed and for ten seconds, shut his eyes in silence. Opening them, he faced Josee who quietly seeped her tea.

"Your words wrung true, Lady Josephine. No, my savior"

But upon hearing those words, Josee suddenly shivered.

'... Fuck. If you dare say shit like that again i'll slap you'

"I will continue being the lord of Galile", Erikur explained. His voice slowly grew softer, as the calmness returned to him.

"and focus my attention for my daugther's recovery. And...", he shot a determined gaze at Josee.

"I can be at peace, knowing you'll kill them all... don't you?"

The light penetrating the windows seemed to grow stronger, encapsulating Josee's figure in an almost otherwordly aura that made it seemed like a beautiful painting.

Josee lightly seeped her tea with closed eyes.

Putting her tea cup down. She looked at him with half-closed eyes.

"... Let's discuss my payment"

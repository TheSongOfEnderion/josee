# Chapter 11 - Seed of Darkness

'... Well shit', Josee calmly walked towards the Pedonas Family's young daughter. The young girl face showed pain and sweat.

As Josee tightly grasped the violently wrigling dark hand and burned it, the scream from the small portal in her chest grew louder.

"Mi-Milady!", Schulga let out a smile of relief. But soon after his face broke into pain.

"L-Lady Josephine", Jorgen stared in horror as Josee casually walked, burning the shadowy entity in her hands.

Arriving next to the young mistress, Josee then casually pushed her hand into the portal, causing her hand to disappear inside. Seein this caused great alarm to everywhere, but they remained quiet, waiting for her decision.

'... Now then, show me what you really are'

The Flames of Cinder expanded, bringing light and warmth into a dark, shadowy dimension. But as the flames reached deeper, it suddenly ellumiated a collosal entity, quiety shivering and hiding in the dark.

A thousand arm, writhing and struggling all covered its mysterious body. An amalgamation of darkness and unknown aspects, it was a pulsing creature that feeds off the soul of its victim.

And the flames reached below, a certain anger emerged within Josee. A vision of a past from hundreds of thousands of years ago. Dark collosal entities that raomed the land, a slow and protracted genocide that ended all life.

And amidst those memories were entities being born from inside royalties.

Beings whose sole purpose were to open the gates for their arrival.

Traitors.

Backstabbers.

They were dark entities that took advantage of man's short life to hide themselves in the shadows.

We must kill them.

Kill them.

Destroy them.

Burn them to Ash!

We cannot let the past repeat itself.

You [############] must end the cycle.

Josee opened her eyes widely. Sweat poured from her forehead. From within the darkness inside the Pedonas Family's daughter, hundreds of shadowy spike came from the entity to the outside world, penetrating Josee's body a hundred times.

"Milady!", Schulga raised his sword. Pointed exactly at the young girl laying on the bend.

"No!!!", Jorgen stared in horror as he held Schulga's hands.

"By Ysmir!", Arina stared in shock as she began casting a magic in her hand.

But Flames of Cinder would not be stoked.

Josee's body burned brightly, causing intense heat in the room and forcing the three expectators to flee into a distance.

As the dark shadowy spikes burned, Josee's eyes sharpened. The Flames coalescend in her right hand, forming a sharp and thick spear of fire! Holding it with both hands, Josee penetrated the dark hole within the girl.

*KRAHGHGHHHFHF**

A shivering scream echoed through the mansion. Guards from every corner began rushing towards the room, as they felt danger arrive.

"... Block the entrance Jorgen!", Josee shouted. As Josee forced her Flame spear into the hole, a wringly mass of dark tentacles emerged.

Jorgen woke up from his shock as he heard Josee speak.

"... Stop anyone from coming to the room!", Josee fiercely glared at Jorgen.

But Jorgen remained frozen in shock.

"... Move your fuckign fat ass!", Josee angrily shouted, "If I can't concentrate in killing this thing, I'll kill your young lady so fucking do it!"

"Y-Yes!", Jorgen immediately left the room and blocked the door.

"... And bring me an oathmaker from the temple of death!", Josee shouted in annoyance.

"... Shit", she cursed.

'... I just wanted a damn boat, now i had to kill a relic of the chaos titans', Josee gnashed her teeth tightly.

'... To think they're actually hiding here. That means to get here, there must be some kind of gate that had to be opened from this side', but Josee immedaitely regained her calm. A dark shadowy spike suddenly slithered and aimed at her head. Pulling her left hand, she caught it and immediately burned it.

'... That changes things', a cruel glint of light emerged from her eyes, '... I need to find those gates and destroy it'

And with great vigor, as if the Flames of Cinder had its own life, the fire grew intensely and began burning everything inside the darkness.

Schulga watched in silence. The dark entity would try to release its hands or spikes to hurt his noble lady, and she she simply fling them away and burned them.

He turned to his left and saw the astonished mage, Arina, watched in silence.

"Tell me", Schulga asked, "Do you have any idea what's happening?"

"I... I don't know", Arina replied in dismay.

"I am aware of the Soul Arts and the curse on the young lady must definitely be because of that. But I have never heard of this kind of... thing. Maybe that entity is hiding in her soul"

"I see", Schulga frowned. He stared forward and saw a spike penetrated Josee's hands, but she merely shrugged it and the wounds burned away, healing her.

'I had already suspected it when I saw her in the Cursed Forest', Schulga watched in silence, 'But she really can heal almost instantaneously'

'So this is milady's powers...', Schulga turned his eyes downward, 'Maybe if she awakened much earlier. She could have saved her Mother'

'No', Schulga shook his head.

'Let's not get distracted'

Josee's battle continued with the dark entity. Her hand fully inside the dark portal in the young girl's chest. As the Flames of Cinder burned, it struggled and kept attacking her with rapid forces and strikes. But all were rendered useless against's Josee's healing. After a while, the flames fully devoured the dark entity until there was not even ashes left.

She calmly pulled her right hand out of the portal. As the last bits its existence disappeared, so did any remaints of the darkness.

Josee stood calmly. Her clothes were tattered and filled with a lot of holes. Suddenly, she felt a warm hand on her shoulder, placing a robe over her body.

"Milady, are you alright?", Schulga asked with a worried frown as he covered her with a red coat he borrowed from Arina.

"... I am fine", Josee replied while flicking her hair.

"Me... Melisia?", a quivering voice caught her attention. A man in an opulet red suit slowly approached the bed. Josee turned towards it and saw the young girl slowly opening her eyes.

Quickly, the man sat besides her, and the girl grew more cognizant.

"F-Father?", Melisia spoke with a hoarse, thirsted voice.

"M-Melisa... you're awake. You're awake!", the man in an opulent red suit could no longer take it and cried, hugging his daughter tightly with his hands.

Josee turned around and saw the shocked expression of everyone in the room. Jorgen stood there with wide eyes whilst Arina slowly approached with her hands in her chest. A few guards were peeking from the door.

Suddenly from the door, a group of maids pushed through carrying a tray of soup, water, and towels.

"Thank you. I am truly grateful", Jorgen approached Josee. Seeing his young lady finally wake up, the fat bellied steward could help but feel teary.

"... Ok", Josee noted. She turned to the back and saw a man quietly standing with blind folded eyes. He was wearing a white robe, almost too white. besides him was a young boy who was holding his hands, no older than 12.

Josee walked behind the crying  man by the bed and spoke.

"... You can cry later, we have business. immedaitely", Josee coldly ordered. 

Feeling her sudden rude remark, some of the guards became riled up and even Jorgen frowned.

"Lady Josephine", jorgen stepped forward, "The Lord is currently at a sensitive moment, please, let us deal with this late-"

"... No", she replied..

"... And you're an incompetent steward", Josee glared with fierce, almost violent eyes that made Jorgen shiver.

"... I had asked you to block off entry from the door...", a vein popped in her forehead, "... and now everyone in the fucking world sees what happened here. Did you even use your brain? Look at your servants and guards peeking through like it's a fucking amusement park? Are you retarded you piece of shit?"

"Argh!!", Jorgen finally realized his mistake. In the heat of the moment and his flush of emotion, he had forgotten his duties.

Naturally, he understood why Josee wanted to keep things here a secret.

"She's right Jorgen", the mayor stood up, wiping the tears from his eyes. He was a rich-looking man with a clean side-parted blonde hair and green eyes.

"Everyone, dismi-", but as he spoke, Josee cut him off.

"...No", Josee interrupted.

"... Gather every servant in the mansion, and even any servant from outside nearby and have them swear an oath with the Oathmaker from the temple of death. To not speak in anyway of the even that happened here unless i permitted it"

Josee turned to face the mayor with firm eyes.

"Hmmm", the mayor silently groaned, "And if I refuse?"

"... I will massacre everyone in this mansion"

"Very well", Erik sighed. But deep inside, his back was sweating.

He had seen what happened. A shadowy entity had taken hold of his daughter. As the mayor of the free city, he was well versed in the world of magic as he had to deal with it in great importance. Jorgen had filled him up with what had happen at first and he came to a conclusion.

Almost very few people would have been able to do what Josee just did. 

They say powerful beings all had a screw loose in their heads, because they have the rights to do so.

'She reminds me of the Master of the Golden Tower', Erik grit his teeth inwardly.

That's why when Josee threated to massacre them, he dare not take it seriously.

"Gather everyone in this mansion and have them make an oath. No one shall be left behind!"

◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

Within the private lobby room of the Pedonas family mansion where they put their most esteemed guest, Josee sat quietly at the soft and nice sofa, drinking tea while Schulga was merely quiet, standing up behind her.

An hour passed and all servants within the Pedonas Family's grounds were all made to swore before the God of Death.

The Oath of Death. It was the heaviest oath where any transgression would result in an immediate death, and only a Sacramented Blind Priest would have the right to do so.

Josee remembered the temple of the God of Death. But it wasn't used much in the novel. Unlike the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Moon, this temple was quiet and almost non-existent.

"... But death arrives at us all", Josee uttered with melancholy as she sipped the tea. Wearing a nice and simple red dress she asked from the servants, Josee felt refreshed after having a change of clothes.

Moments later, the door opened and a man entered pushing girl in a wheel chair. There was liveliness and warmth in her face, as the young blonde girl

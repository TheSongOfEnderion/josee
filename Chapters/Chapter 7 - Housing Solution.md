# Chapter 7  - Housing Solution

In the middle of the night, amidst the deep and giant trees of the Cursed Forest, a woman is running from branches to branches.

Her speed was deft, nimbly jumping from one branch to another. But eventually, her feet slip down, causing her to fall ten meters below.

As her back hit the ground, Josee puked a mouthful of blood. The pain seared through her back as her spine broke.

On top of the foliage branches was a giant snake, fifteen meters long and thick enough to easily devour two men. Despite its size, it nimbly slithered from branches to branches as if it had no weight.

Bearing its fangs, it spiraled down a tree trunk towards Josee. A fraction of a section passed, and it was already five meters before her.

The flames engulfed Josee's back. And as the Fang bear close to her body, Josee rapidly sprung sideways, propelled by a sudden explosion of fire.

Caught off guard, the giant python closed its eyes as the fire burned its face. It madly hissed and turned its head away from Josee.

Wielding a dagger in her right hand, Josee quickly jumped to the back of the giant python. Because of the explosive fire, it had become momentarily blinded and began thrashing around aimless, in a bid to throw Josee off.

Josee sharpened her eyes. Her dagger immediately reached searing temperature. Stabbing it into the python, it bypassed its tough scales, causing it to hiss in pain.

"Krishhahh!!!!"

Josee almost lost her balance as the python trashed so much that Josee broke her legs when it hit a tree trunk. But the flames immediately healed her body, allowing her to regain her balance once more.

Holding the dagger with both hands, Josee unleashed a tremendous flame, dotting the dark forest with a blazing light.

"KRISSSHHh!!!", the giant python hissed. The pain surged through its body, turning it into a mindless beast.

Josee jumped back and landed on the leafy ground. At the wake of her blazing attack, left the giant python's ten-meter long tail, severed from its body.

"KRASSHHH!", the python hissed, and like a bullet, it swiftly turned around and coiled around many trees. It's fangs immediately right in front!. 

She gnashed her teeth. Without enough time to dodge, Josee pulled her sword and blocked the Python's Fangs. Standing her ground, Josee held the Python's full force for five seconds. The bones in her arms were ripped to a thousand pieces, her right leg gave in, and her entire rib cage burst to pieces.

Josee coughed a large amount of blood, with even bits of flesh and bone flying out. Her eyes collapsed in a desperate hue, immediately losing her consciousness from the pain.

But the flames would not be stoked.

Josee woke her eyes once more. The giant python curling and crushing her body over and over again. Her lungs collapsed and unable to breath, Josee passed out once more.

As the cycle of rebirth and death kept repeating over and over again, a certain thought came to Josee.

A thought of giving up.

But such thought reminded her of what she once were. A helpless woman in a cold frozen field in the middle of nowhere, forgotten and abandoned.

And it only made her angry.

Death, rebirth, death, rebirth. Though gravely injured, the giant python's instinct to live remained strong, constricting and crushing Josee with all its weight.

Thirty minutes passed, and the two still remained in deadlock. And after many hundreds of death, a fire burned within Josee's brain.

The fire recreated her brain faster than it would be destroyed. Burning and shining bright that it made the Python nervous. But no matter how many times it constricted its body, it could not stoke the fire.

No matter how many times she died, Josee remained awake. Her consciousness fully aware of what is happening. With no nerves to bring her pain, Josee's mind was at peace. And with a wave of her mind, a great fire suddenly engulfed the giant python, causing it to shrivel and loosen its grasp. It immediately rushed for a body of water, its eyes melted by the intense heat, purely led by its instincts.

Josee stepped into the Earth. Her body instantly reformed by the flames.

Like a goddess walking the mortal plane, Josee's naked figure seared like the sun.

The python emerged from the laked, its body charred black from the fire. Realizing the walking, living flame, the Python decided to retreat. it's body rapidly slithered out of the forest.

Josee watched as the Python left.

But the battle was not over.

In her right hand, Josee formed a spear made of fire. Positioning her left foot forward and lower her hips, Josee violently threw the spear! 

The giant python  slithered, destroying every obstacle or animals that stood in its way. But as it almost left that part of the forest, it suddenly felt a burning sensation in its chest.

The Flames penetrated.

And the giant python was burned. Its heart melted from the searing heat.

The battle was over, and Josee finally let go of the fire that burns her body.

"... Ahhh... ", without even any strength left to stay awake, Josee fell to the ground.

There, in the middle of the night with the moon hanging in the sky, Josee peacefully slept.


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


Josee heaved a sigh of relief as she rested in the bath tub.

Waking this morning in the middle of the forest, Josee found herself surrounded by monsters, each warily waiting for her to move.

'...not the most pleasant sight in the world', Josee shook her head.

Standing up from the tub, Josee stared at a mirror and saw her body. Without any scars, all she saw was the pristine body of a young woman.

'... In spite of her lazy nature. Josephine didn't have any excess fat. Oh wait, that might just be poverty'

Suddenly, Josee realized that her muscles grew tighter, and that there was a certain strength in it.

"... Hmmm"

'... I dont want to be a muscle mommy'

After finishing dawdling around, Josee left the bath. Dressed in a white gown with her hair tied in a towel, she left towards her office only to see Alex standing inside.

"Ah. Goodmorning milady", he lightly bowed.

"... What do we have today?", Josee asked as she sat on the office chair and drinking the tea that Misha prepared before hand.

"The villagers mined the limestone we found in the shores last time. They're all inside a shed in the outskirts"

Josee lightly raised her eyebrows.

"... Oh. Good. And the carpenters?"

"Yes. They're busy building the thing you instructed. They say they'll have it done this week"

"... Oh. Good. And the carpenters?"

"Yes. They're busy building that thing you instructed. They say they'll have it done this week"


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

After dealing with a few affairs in the territory, Josee stepped into the barrack training grounds and begun her morning routine of training with Schulga.

"My lady", Schulga lightly asked. His wooden sword deflected Josee's blade with ease.

"You entered the Cursed Forest last night again didn't' you?", Schulga frowned with worry as he took a step back and dodged Josee's sword.

"... I did", josee heavily struck schulga's sword, causing his hands to shake.

'She grew stronger', Schulga assessed.

"I know you can heal your wounds",  quickly, schulga pushed Josee's blade and took a step back.

"But please. Don't be too reckless. I have read the family records, and there are monsters capable of destroying entire cities deep within the forest", Schulga remembered those text. At first, he could not believe them, but over the years, the things he had seen come out of the Cursed Forest made him believe there truly were horrors beyond his understanding.

"... You don't need to worry", Josee attacked again, holding her sword with both hands.

"... I know my limits"

After their morning routine, Josee took another bath before going to the kiln built near the outskirts of the village on the rocky mountain.

Wearing leather pants and a sleeveless shirt that Josee personally cut, Josee stood proudly with her brown hair tied in a ponytail.

Behind her was Schulga and some four guards.

Surrounded by trees, a shed was temporarily made, and inside were sacks of limestone that Josee asked the village workers to find for her.

"... Well. Now i have a solution for the housing problem"

"Milady", Schulga squat before the limestone sacks inside the small shed 

"What do we need these cave stones for", Schulga wondered. He had always seen these as dangerous stones formed in caves. You never knew when they'd fall and if they did, it could kill even the most veteran of warriors.

"...You'll see", Josee continued.

"... Tie the sacks then use the mallets to break the stones to pieces", after ordering them, they began crushing the limestones to tiny pieces. Josee herself took a mallet and began crushing them.

And to their surprise, a single hit from Josee made the ground crack and almost burst the sack. Even she didn't realize how strong she's become.

"Milady", Schulga wryly smiled, "You truly are going stronger everyday"

After half an hour of pulverizing the limestones, Josee ordered them to drop a few sacks inside the kiln.

"... Stay back, this will be hot", Josee raised her right hand before the kiln. Thr kiln burned bright from the intense heat that Josee released. It was so hot that he guards and Schulga took a hundred steps back to not get caught by the heat.

In the mean time, Misha and a few servants from the mansion arrived, carrying carts of food and drinks. The guards were immediately elated as the food soup even contained dried meat from Josee's last hunt.

An hour passed and Schulga and the rest kept waiting until they noticed Josee stop her flames.

"... Done", Josee stared at the kiln and saw the red hot limestone. The smoke released was a bit unbearable and luckily, Josee could control the flame, forcing hot air to push the smoke away

'... To create primitive cement, a high temperature is needed for calcination of limestone. Once the carbon dioxide is driven off, you're left with calcium oxide. Also known as quicklime'

Josee stepped towards the kiln before picking up a red hot stone. Seeing this, the guards flinched.

Schulga however, knew she was immune to heat. Still, it made him uncomfortable seeing someone touch something searing hot.

After holding the stone in Josee's hand, it immediately crumbled to dust.

'... Might have overdone the heat a bit, but that looks just fine to me'

Josee repeated the same steps until she had approximately ten sacks of quicklime

Taking the water from a bucket, a few cups of sand and gravel from a sack, Schulga began mixing the mixture with quicklime. 

"... Remember to always wear a mask when dealing with quicklime and never to directly touch it. Theyre harmful to your health"

Josee reminded them. The guards, hearing this, nodded their head profusely.

After that's done, Josee asked Schulga to connect two bricks together using the primitive concrete mixture. Then using two box made of wood, Josee ordered him to pour concrete on those two.

Satiesfied with its look, Josee lightly smiled.

"Milady, will this really make this brick combine?"

"... Yes. It's called cement. Leave them inside the shed and tomorrow it'll cure and harden"

But as Josee said this, her mind began forming plans.

'...I can't do this myself all the time. Therefore i need a fuel source. Coal? Hmmm... These lands aren't rich in coal. Maybe i can import oil from the eastern dessert. Wait, magic is readily accessible. Fire runes can definitely solve the problem but it requires mana stone'

'... But.... hmmm...I know a way to gather a LOT of mana stone. It wouldn't be an issue. Therefore, i just need to find a runic master'

"... Schulga, when will this friend of yours respond?"

"Oh. You mean Bolli. He should receive the letter by tomorrow. He still owe me therefore he definitely will not ignore it"

".... Good"


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


The cold north is a land of unforgiving nature, where Life could barely live.

Amidst the cold storm and the foggy hailing land laid a majestic, iron fortress. Standing aloft,ight shined within. The fortress was built, facing something it guards against.

And that something was a giant wall, a kilometer long, towering five hundred meters tall.

Armies stood in front of the Wall. Hundreds of thousands of men, each wearing cold armor,.ready to battle to the death.

Amongst this was a beautiful woman dressed in golden armor seating on a gold armoured knight horse. A battle maiden wielding an axe behind her back.

As the snowy fog hailed upon them, a man dressed in dark armor approached her in a horse.

"Lady Cerine", the man places his right hand across his chest, lightly bowing in respect to the beautiful woman.

She lightly opened her eyes, revealing blue eyes as pure as the ocean.

"The forces are ready", the man reported, "The Talimor Archfamily has arrived and already positioned themselves"

"As tardy as always", the woman cruelly replied.

She stared forward unto the giant walls. In its center lies a titanic door, one that only a titan could have opened.

Suddenly, a banging sound occured. The ground shook, and the earth shivered, as jf a great horror was about to come.

"How many soldiers will we lose this round?", the man in a dark armor sighed.

"My Lady", he turned to her to ask. "Are we really not going to implore the center kingdoms? They have lived long and ignorant of the plight of our world. If not for us, they would all be run over by horrors"

"Its useless", Cerine replied, "They are too far from the north, and the ridge separating us is too wide a gap for any sensible logistics to pass"

"Still", she continued, "our old ways of keeping this horror to ourselves are failing"

The wall shook once again, each banging sending shivers down the spine of every men and women.

"My lady", the man in dark armor spoke.

"The Magus Tower...", Cerine started, "have discovered the ancient teleportation spell. Soon, the central and southern continent can no longer seat idly"

A maddening flash appeared in her eyes.

"They too, must burn like us"

The banging reached such a strong point that some of the people began falling to the ground. Cerine took a sword from her hips, and a ray of Gold shined upon the battlefield.

The armies, each carrying a banner of a different household or kingdom all stared in her direction. As the commander and forefront of this battle, Cerine became like a beacon of hope.

With a reverberating tremor she shouted.

"Today, we will fight for the Survival of our world. Today, we die so that the children of our future will inherit a world devoid of horrors. We wil fight, down to the last man!"

Pointing her sword forward, a group of mages near the walls began chanting their spells. And with great pressure, the titanic door fitted at the collosal walls finally opened.

"RARGGHHHHH!!!", A fifteen meter tall monster monster bearing terrible fangs and collosal wings came out of the gate. Its arms were bulging with terrifying muscles, with veins of smoldering heat. Its hind legs were the shape of a hors.Behind it were smaller monsters, each ravaged by bloodlust and murder.

"Fire the Ballista!", Cerine shouted.

And from the back of the armies, giant harpoons the size of houses were manned by dozens of soldiers. A terrible spell was ignited on those giant bows, releasing fifteen harpoons.

The collosal monster was struck in every part of its body. Not only that, every time a harpoon hit, it released a terrible storm of lightning that killed any of the nearby monsters.

The giant monster fell to the ground. It's body, shivering and charred from the terrible lighting.

But it wasn't over.

Cerine raised her right hand and made a fist sign. All the soldiers in her front, each wearing heavy armor positioned their door-shield in front. From behind them were great spear-men, protruding their weapons, ready to bite their enemy. The other armies also held the same tactics, though they differ in color, all of them followed the same.

Suddenly, a man in a purple horse galloped next to Cerine.

"Horatrio", Cerine spoke. The man in front of her was in his middle age. Wearing a dark-purple armor bearing the crest of a purple rose, he stopped before her and spoke. His voice carried great alarm, as he breathed roughly.

"Commander Cerine", he breathed heavily, "Bad News"

"What news?", Cerine deeply frowned. Tightly gripping her sword.

Griting his teeth, Hortario reported.

"The Magus tower detected a great deal of Magiak Energy from the south"

"What?!", Cerine gnashed her teeth. Madness seem to glint from her eyes.

"That's not possible, we sealed the South a thousand years ago!"

"That's the problem", Hortario continued, "We're not sure if it's the same place. Or a new chasm"

The monsters blocked by the fallen collosal all succeeded in passing through its body. As their terrible rampage begun, each soldier at the front all tighted their grind of their shield.

Cerine turned towards the Great Wall, lightly biting her lip.

"The Gods have abandoned us", Cerine cursed, "This damned world!"

Cerine took a two-meter long bow from her back and with great strength, knocked a bow inside. A Great deal of mana coalescend in her hand before releasing it. A terrible and holy light emerged, destroying everything in her front, cleaving a path of monsters.

Determination and anger filled Cerine's mind. 

The long winded battle occured, a war of attrition that claimed the life of many young soldiers and great warriors.

But for the future of this world, no price was too high to pay.

And that price, will be paid in full.

◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

"What? How is this possible?", after smashing with a mallet, Schulga learned that the two bricks were inseperable. The once liquid rock was now as solid as any stone.

"Whoahh", the guards around them clapped in awe.

"Wait, if we have this. We won't even need to cut stones properly anymore!", the guard captain, Anthony smiled in awe.

"That's right", another guard noted, "Any stone will do and we can just fill it with this and it'll be just as strong!"

"Impressive", Schulga's eyes shook at the thought.

To create great buildings, one needs to hire masons who will cut stones into properly sized pieces that fits one another. This is specially time consuming and only a skilled mason can be trusted with cutting the stones. They will then need to use mortar to bind the stones together.

'That's the reason why walls, buildings, and houses are expensive to build', Schulga gulped.

'But this material. Cement. Doesn't this mean. We will have a new era of construction?''

From the side, Josee simply watched in silence. Wearing her leather pants and white long sleeve, she merely nodded.

"... Alright, enough dallying, Schulga, hit the two concrete blocks until it breaks", Josee stood quietly before the concrete products. She almost looked unimpressed and even annoyed.

Schulga nodded and took his mallet before slamming them repeatedly on the concrete block. After about five hits, the block started showing signs of cracking.

"... That's enough", Josee squat down and began examining the blocks.

'... Looks just about right. It's good i still remember the correct ratios', She turned towards Schulga and asked.

"... How did it feel?"

"Like hitting solid rock, milady", Schulga smiled.

"Good", Josee stood up and folded her hands.

"Gather the carpenters and smith. And bring Friedrich to me"

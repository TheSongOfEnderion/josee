# Chapter 8  - Solving Problems (3)

The Night looms dark within the Cursed Forest. The towering collosal trees, the quiet movement of the roots, the roots flowing everywhere and the vines hanging over the leaves all gave a disturbing atmosphere.

Wearing an adventurer's clothes made of boar skin, leather pants, jacket, and a small coat at her back, Josee walked through the cursed forest.

Delving deeper into this dark land, Josee began seeing shadows and strange entities manifest from the corners, so much that it made her hair rise at ends.

And when she stopped for a moment, she saw an entity mimic her entire body. But it was flawed as it had no face. And when she blinked her eyes, it disppeared as if it was never there.

Josee felt creeped all over her skin that she thought of just coming back to Aquel.

'... So the deeper you goes, the more mysterious the monsters become'

But she pressed onwards.

'... But I've always wondered. Nobody knows what caused the Cursed Forest. Not even mentioned in the original novel nor in the Kalingrad Family records'

'... All I know is that the Cinder Flames has kept these creatures from fully spilling out into the world. Nothing else'

After appearing at a clearing, Josee felt a stab behind her back, penetrating her back and killing her instantly. 

The flames would not be stoked. And when Josee opened her eyes, there was nothing but darkness. She moved her limbs and found her mouth, hands, and feet were tangled.

'... Something  binded me?', Josee frowned and begun releasing the Flames of Cinder, burning her surrounding to a crisp. Suddenly, she heard a huge shriek that made her ears almost split.

As the things binding her burned, Josee felt gravity take over as her body fell. Regaining her sight, Josee saw the ground and many burning white silks, as well as dozens of cocoons.

'... A spider?', Maneauvering her body in the air, Josee stabbed her sword towards a nearby tree and swiftly prevented her fall.

"KURAHHH!!!", the shriek came again and josee stared at the far tree above.

As the moon light shines through the dense tree leaves, Josee saw a giant spider ten meters wide wriggling onto the trees as it tried to put out the fire that enveloped it.

'... But nothing can abolish the Flames of Cinder', Josee coldly thought. She took an axe and stabbed it at the tree trunk. Pulling and keeping her sword in her sheathe, Josee also took a second axe and begun swiftly climbing through the trees.

As the embers enveloped Josee's clothing, her eyes swiftly aimed at the writhing Spider. With a strength that even took her by surprise, Josee was able to climb twenty meters on trunk in under ten seconds.

'... I didn't knew my body grew stronger'

The giant spider begun spitting silks after silks on its burning back in an attempt to smoulder the fire.

But it only caused the flames to grow stronger.

Eventually, the spider moves its eyes and began moving towards the direction of a river. 

Unfortunately, Josee was already at the top of a branch before it begun moving. Jumping towards the spider, Josee quickly reached its back, embedding the her cinder axe. 

"KRUEHHH!!"

Flames covered Josee's body as the Cinder kept devouring the beast.

And so the chase begun as it leaped through the trees, creating great damages on the tree trunks. It madly spewed silk everywhere, carrying Flames that burned its path.

Worried that the Flames of Cinder would burn the whole forest, a single thought from Josee caused those excess flames to disappear.

Pulling her arm strength, Josee begun climbing through the Giant spider until she reached the center of its back. Her left hand kept holding the axe while she embeded the right axe below to use as footing. Pulling her iron sword, it blazed with Flame as Josee violently stabbed it into the Spider's body.

"KRYAGGGG!", the beast violently moaned, moving rapdily up and down to push Josee away. 

The Flames of Cinder grew stronger, but Josee did not let it go wild.

Calming her mind, she carefully controlled the flames and concentrating its power, burning the Spider slowly and steadily.

But in her state of focus, Josee suddenly felt her body go lighter. The spider delved into a giant lake she has never seen before.

'... Ah, this asshole!'

Diving into the dark waters. Josee braced herself and held her breath.

The impact force caused Josee to let go of her footing, slowly floating through the water. Opening her eyes, the warm light of the Cinder Flames glowed a shade of orange in this deep, dark blue lake.

Soon, the spider found the flames would not be stoked by mere water. And maddened from the pain, it soon found Josee.

"AkRARSHJ!!", in an almost famished gurgle of a shriek, it swam fast and the giant spider lunged deep towards Josee.

Pulling her arms forward, Josee begun concentrating as she held her breath.

The Flames grew hotter and began vaporizing the water around Josee, creating a sphere of fire. A layer of continnuous steam  surrounded the flames, almost blocking Josee's view. 

She waited for a few moments. And when the Giant Spider lunges its fangs at her, entering the flames, Josee decided to hold its giant fangs with her hands and feet, preventing it from closing. The flames surrounding her began to envelop its upper body.

But Josee soon found that she overestimated her strength. The strength of the Spider's Jaws were no joke and as the breath left her body, she was instantly folded in half.

Blood reeked into the dark waters as the maddened spider ate her in one go. The giant spider struggled to get out of the waters, but its leg became weak as one after another it dettached itself.

Moments later, it felt a burning feeling from within it. And as it fell sunked deeper, the moonlight disappears, the waters came rushing to its body, and the heat began melting its form.

The spider drew its last breathe, sunking into the lake floor.

Josee opened her eyes. The poison and silk all drowned her, torturing her into an almost perpetual rebirth and death scenario. But this was not her first time, nor will it be the last. As the pain resurfaced as soon as she regained her consciousness, Josee felt really dying for real.

The process repeated itself over and over until Josee was able to maintain her brain's integrity. Though there was nothing but darkness and silence, her soul's connection to the Flames of Cinder grew stronger.

And it heard her call.

She concentrated again. And with her hands reconstructing from ash, Josee waved her hand and sliced through the Giant Spider's tough carcass. She waved her hand twice more and created a triangle opening.

With her body's concentrated regeneration. Josee opened her eyes and with a torrent of Flames, pushed the spider's meat out of the carcass, escaping outside into the dark waters.

But Josee faced another problem. For there was no air, nothing she could breath. The sheer pressure of the water collapse her lungs instantly killing her.

The blood seeped through her body, and josee opened her eyes only to see nothing but darkness.

But the Flames would not be stoked.

Josee gnashed her teeth, and once more, with great will, created a sphere of flame around her.

The flames grew powerful and begun emitting a tremendous light, illuminating the darkness. The water around her vaporized as Josee landed on the dry ground of the lake floor. But she still could not breath as the lack of air almost immediately killed her.

Pushing her will to regenerate her internal organs, Josee stood up with great effort. Her sight grew blurry for every
passing moment.

Her lungs, brains, organs, all collapsing and healing. Her heart beating so fast that Josee felt delirium.

'... Fuck. I need to rise up. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.', Josee cursed inside as she clawed her heart, bleeding it and almost revealing the bones of her chest.

But as Josee readied her feet to rise up, she suddenly saw something from the distance. Her eyes blurred but she clearly saw somethiing that made it widen.

It was the roof of a tower made of stone. Its circular body and broken red bricked roof almost felt familiar to Josee. And yet a question appeared in her mind.

What the hell was it doing down here?

But the pain of her organ failure and regenerating instantly brought Josee back to reality. With her legs bent over, Josee pushed with all of her strength and jumped into the waters above.

Swimming with great fervor, Josee eventually saw the moonlight, embracing her again like a lost child.

After a minute of racing to the surface which felt like eternity, Josee finally escaped the waters.

Breathing deeply for a solid ten seconds, Josee opened her crimson eyes wide.

"... haah... haaah... haaah....", the trauma and fear filled her eyes as her body shivered. Josee, in a bid of panic, quicly swam to the shores. Her voice became a gurggled mess of spasm.

Reaching the shores, Josee crawled to the ground. Her body barely covered by the remnants of her leather cloth.

And for the first time in this world... Josee felt cold. She curled up in a fetal position as her body shivered.

The dark became embedded in her mind.

The loneliness, the abscence of light, all of it caused the trauma of her first death, her first life to repeat itself over and over again.

She curled tighter as tears fell from her eyes.

And only in those moments, Josee disappeared.

Only she was left.


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


My life was filled with many suffering.

From a young age, I was abandoned by my parents at a poor orphanage. Due to limited government funds, we had to work and earn a living. The children were helping in taking care of the farm while the older kids goes out to find odd jobs to help buy food.

And to earn a few coins, I decided to work as drainage shoveler at the age of 11.

Shovelling the city's drainage, cleaning shit. The rotting pungent smell would last on my skin for days and the crawling of coackraches always made me puke.

But it paid well, and I was able to ease the burden of the nuns working in our orphanage.

It was a simple life. It was hard, but we were one big family.

And I was content.

But I had to grow up. And soon, I found myself apprenticing at the local machine shop.

It's not that i couldn't get a job as a waiter or a food store helper. It simply paid better.

So I worked there, almost losing my fingers from the roaring lathe machines and drill press. But it was interesting, and I was a quick learner and a hardworking kid so the machine shop owner took me fondly.

It wasn't so bad.

But there were days were we only ate salted rice or few pieces of bread. Specially when a storm arrived, wiping our vegetables away or when a draught came and we couldn't get any water.

What sin did I commit in my past life to deserve this?

Why did my parents abandoned me? Was I really undesirable?

There were days when I wished they would come back. All of us do.

Staring at the orphanage door from time to time, we all imagined they would come back.

But nobody ever came back.

And at a young age, I threw away such delusions.

To hell with my shitty parents! Fuck them both! They can die for all I care!

Education was the only thing that will bring me out of this poverty. So I studied, I attended school while working after class. I didn't have time to make friends or enjoy my youth.

Study. Work. Study. Work.

That was all I ever did, that was all I ever knew.

And on the day I passed a rigorous college examination and obtained a full scholarship, for the first time in my life I felt so proud.

Those were the nicer days.

Until I graduated top of my class. A Magna Cum Laude in Mechanical Engineering, the first in decades.

That's right... everything was going well.

Until I graduated.

I opened my eyes.

The light of the morning sun permeated through the trees.

As I opened my heavy eyes, I smelt the scent of burned ash and the warm glow of fire. I passed out right before this lake. And surrounding was a circle of fire and the bodies of monsters burned to ash.

"... Ah... how peculiar"

The memories of last night haunted me that i held my neck in reflex.

I was too reckless, too reliant on my power.

Death does not feel good.

"... But I have to keep moving forward", I gritted my teeth.

The flames of cinder came out of my hands, forming a crescent shape from my will.

Suddenly, I felt the presence of monsters emerging from the forest, slowly encrouching at me.

"... The Price of rapid growth is a heavy price to pay."

I closed my eyes in pain, before opening it again.

'... Saving this world is not my ultimate goal'

I gnashed her teeth.

'.. I'll find a way... not matter what...'

"... I will return", and in a shivering voice as if I was the same little girl from the orphange, I uttered.
 
"... Just wait for me everyone. I will come back"

The Flames of Cinder grew brighter. And from the ash of my body, a thousand orbs of fire came out.

Penetrating every monster in my vicinity.


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


Three days passed.

Within the forest near aquel, a group of guards, a knight, and a woman in a yellow simple dress stood near a wooden shed. On the ground was a concrete brick with marks of hammering, but no signs of crack.

"What? How is this possible?", after smashing with a mallet, Schulga learned that the two bricks combined with concrete were inseparable. The once liquid rock was now as solid as any stone.

"Whoahh", the guards around them clapped in awe.

"Wait, if we have this. We won't even need to cut stones properly anymore!", the guard captain, Anthony smiled in awe.

"That's right", another guard noted, "Any stone will do and we can just fill it with this and it'll be just as strong!"

"Impressive", Schulga's eyes shook at the thought.

To create great buildings, one needs to hire masons who will cut stones into properly sized pieces that fits one another. This is specially time consuming and only a skilled mason can be trusted with cutting the stones. They will then need to use mortar to bind the stones together.

'That's the reason why walls, buildings, and houses are expensive to build', Schulga gulped.

'But this material. Cement. Doesn't this mean. We will have a new era of construction?''

From the side, Josee simply watched in silence. Wearing her simple yellow dress, she merely nodded. She turned to the side and saw two blocks made entirely of concerete.

"... Alright, enough dallying, Schulga, hit the two concrete blocks until it breaks", Josee ordered. She almost looked unimpressed and even annoyed.

Schulga nodded and took his mallet before slamming them repeatedly on the concrete block. After about five hits, the block started showing signs of cracking.

"... That's enough", Josee squat down and began examining the blocks.

'... Looks just about right. It's good i still remember the correct ratios', She turned towards Schulga and asked.

"... How did it feel?"

"Like hitting solid rock, milady", Schulga smiled.

"... Good", Josee stood up and folded her hands.

"Bring Friedrich to me"

◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

During her meeting with Friedrich, he explained about fire runes.

"My apologies, milady," Friedrich admitted. "Runes aren't my area of expertise. I can create a basic fire rune, but its heat wouldn't be enough for what you need. And, even a basic fire rune requires a single small mana stone to sustain it for an hour"

"... So you're saying it's unsutainable?"

"Yes. Mana stones are not exactly cheap. You'd be burning gold after gold"

'... Hmm... then I can't use fire runes for my kiln anytime soon'

Josee fell into silence. Fredrich's words immediately erased many different plans she developed with runes in mind.

'... But to say it consumes a lot of mana stone', Josee lightly bit her thumbnail, 'It's most likely an efficiency issue'

To a Mechanical Engineer like Josee, there was no such thing as magic, only hidden mechanisms waiting to be understood. A machine that needs to disassembled and reassembled to fully understand its workings.

Therefore, Josee decided to take matters into her own hands for the time being.

After dismissing Friedrich, Josee took out her journal and begun writing in the to-dos of her growing list.

'... I'm going to have to unlock the true nature of magic one day. But that's a low priority for now'

Josee placed her journal aside and took a large parchment out from the barrel besides her. It was similarly also filled with many rolled up parchment from Josee's constant drafting.

The draft revealed  small pipeline with two check valves next to each other. The first checkvalve was a little bit higher than the other. Next to the two checkvalve was a cylinder about a meter  high. From the looks of it, this small arrangement were designed to be placed between points of flowing water.

Josee then turned around and opened a chest by her side. Looking around the room, it was filled with many wood or metal of strange sizes.

Pulling out an object from the chest, Josee took out a device made of metal that looks exactly like the drawing.

After 3 days of crafting and repeated trial and error, Josee finally got the correct ratios to cause a good waterflow within the ram pump.

'... The cinder flames sure is convenient. I can just reshape the hot metal like clay'

However, Josee noticed the rusting on the metals.

'... Damn. I should have Friedrich teach me lightning magic. Then i'll be able to galvanize this'


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


Several days passed, and Josee poured all her focus into managing Aquel's reconstruction.

As a mechanical engineer, civil engineering wasn't exactly Josee's forte. While she grasped the concepts of loads and moments of force, applying them to buildings instead of machine parts was a different story altogether.

Frustrated by her limited construction knowledge, Josee came to a decision: construct temporary housing for the villagers, to be demolished later when a competent civil engineer could be found.

With Friedrich's contribution of a steady food supply, Josee's cement production, and the occasional hunt for meat from large beasts, the village's basic needs were met.

The rocky shores of Aquel proved advantageous, providing readily available stone for construction.

During that time, Josee also begun digging near the shores of a small channel. Using her fire, she easily melt the stone into lava and begun shovelling them away, allowing her to easily dig.

And then, on the fourth day, the first concrete house in the village stood complete. This initial project served as a learning experience for the village carpenters, who then embarked on the construction of twenty more houses.

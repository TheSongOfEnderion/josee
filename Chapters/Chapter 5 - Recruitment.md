**Chapter 5  - Recruitment**
The sun blazed high in the sky as an unremarkable carriage traversed the winding dirt road that snaked through a desolate forest. A retinue of guards flanked the vehicle, mounted on sturdy horses. Their armor bore the scars of countless battles. Leading the procession was a white-haired knight, his brown steed carrying him with a noble bearing.

Seated within the carriage was Josee, clad in leather pants, a pristine white long-sleeved shirt, and a leather capelet. Her chestnut hair was neatly tied in a ponytail, cascading gently over her shoulder. Beside her sat a demure maid with fiery orange locks, Misha, engrossed in learning to write on a small wooden slate with a piece of chalk.

'The town we're bound for lies within the domain of Count Rotweiss—Greenleaf Town' Josee mused, her thoughts drifting through the landscape beyond the window.

'The main narrative will commence a year from now, with the entrance of our heroine, Celine, arriving in the Royal Capital as a humble baker. There, she will fatefully cross paths with the wounded crown prince, survivor of an assassination attempt. Her hidden healing magic will unexpectedly capture his attention.'

Josee's voice dripped with disdain. "Goddamn it, it's making me puke."

Her revulsion was so profound that she switched to pure English, leaving Misha perplexed and unable to comprehend her sudden outburst.

'If my memory serves me right, one of Celine's devoted followers should be in Greenleaf Town'

"He's mine," Josee declared with a wicked glint in her eyes.

◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

After settling into the inn, Josee dispatched three of her guards, accompanied by Misha, to explore the local blacksmiths and market.

Observing the constant stream of people in the bustling town, situated at the intersection of two roads beside a major river, Josee couldn't help but comment, "This town is rather charming. I'll conquer it later."

Josee left the Inn with her trusted knight along with four guards. They cloaked themselves in long brown coats as they ventured into the town's dimly lit alleys. The filth and stench that assailed them almost made Schulga cringe, but Josee remained indifferent.

"I require something and someone to address our food shortage," Josee confided in her men, her voice low and secretive. They traversed shadowy passages teeming with rough-looking men who glared at Josee's entourage. The well-armed guards in nondescript robes made it clear they wanted no trouble.

Josee leaned closer and whispered, "We shall enter an inn. When I signal, apprehend the man I will point out."

The guards nodded without hesitation, their familiarity with Josee's reputation was enough to instill fear despite her seemingly innocent looks.

Schulga furrowed his brow, wondering if they were about to abduct someone, but then he shook his head.

A few moments later, the group of six arrived in front of a shady tavern nestled in a hidden alley. Its rough-hewn door bore the scars of countless fights, and the pervasive odor of ale permeated the air.

Schulga inquired, "My lady, is this our destination?"

Josee replied with a curt nod and promptly led the way into the dimly lit tavern. The interior was cramped, and its occupants were drunk and rowdy. What stood out, however, were several individuals wearing hooded cloaks, huddled together in whispered conversations.

Josee signaled two of her men to remain outside while the other two followed her inside. The room fell silent as the tavern's patrons observed the newcomers.

As Josee looked around, she finally saw her target.

Moving swiftly, she reached a specific table occupied by a man in a green tunic. He appeared to be asleep, but Josee exchanged a meaningful glance with Schulga. He then nodded at the two other guards, and in an instant, they seized the slumbering man and swiftly dragged him away.

Josee then approached the bartender, who shot her a fierce glare.

"... Provide everyone a drink," Josee said in a hushed tone, dropping five silver coins onto the table.

Witnessing this, the bartender immediately pocketed the coins and grinned. The inn's patrons resumed their usual activities as though nothing had happened.

Josee and her group departed from the tavern. Once they had taken the captive to a secluded corner of the town, Josee ordered them to drop him to a wall. She scrutinized the man, who had shoulder-length light gray hair, an unkempt beard, sunken eyes, a frail physique, and wore a worn-out green tunic.

"... Tsk, how pathetic", Josee commented with a raised lip, revealing the disgust in her face.

"Um. My lady," Schulga asked with furrowed eyes, "Is he going to be of use?"

'He can't possibly be a warrior with that frail body. And I can't detect any mana. A scholar, perhaps?' Schulga assessed the man.

"... He will," Josee remarked, "Philip, pour water on his face. Anthony and the rest, be on guard."

""Yes my lady"" the guards responded in unison.

Guard Philip, a middle-aged man and one of the two guards who gouged the steward's eyes, readily took out his leather flask and poured its contents over the sleeping man's face.

On the other hand, Anthony was the guard's captain.

Moments later, the unconscious man woke up with a jolt.

"Ugh, blrahgh," the man puked water, immediately opening his eyes.

"H-Hey, what's wrong with you?!" he roared after gaining consciousness, only to find the guard pouring water on his face. He frowned deeply. And as he was about to get angry, Josee raised her right hand and slapped him across the face.

The loud sound of the slap even caused Schulga to widen his eyes in shock.

'Is that really how you're supposed to treat a guy you're recruiting?!' Schulga thought, staring in disbelief. The four guards merely kept quiet, with Philip slowly backing away.

"... Are you awake already, you useless piece of shit?" Josee glared with cold eyes.

"W-Wha, who the hell are you?!" the stranger asked, holding his face, reddened from the heavy blow Josee unleashed. His mind, still not catching up to whatever was happening.

"... I am Josephine Kalingrad of the Kalingrad Household," Josee announced. With a deep frown, she continued, "And you're a piece of shit wastrel who spits at the talent gifted upon you by your master."

Hearing those words, the man gnashed his teeth.

"What? How much do you know about m-"

But his outburst was interrupted by another of Josee's slaps. Feeling the pain in his face once more, he glared at her and groaned.

"Did you just come here to mock me? Is that it?"

"... No, I came to hire you," Josee declared.

Hearing her words, the man closed his eyes and slowly stood up, his body almost stumbling down.

'Master?' Schulga thought to himself, 'What is this about?'

The man turned serious and asked, "I am Fredriech. It seems you know who I am. What needs would you have from a failed wizard like me?"

'A wizard!?' Schulga widened his mouth in surprise. The guards turned to each other with fascination in their eyes, but Schulga knew this was no ordinary man. To call himself a wizard, it was a completely different level from a mage.

Josee remained silent for a moment. She closed her eyes before opening them once more.

"... I can fix you," Josee coldly spoke with half-closed eyes, "I can return your mana core back."

Fredriech's eyes slowly widened. Hearing those words that he shouldn't be hearing, he felt as though a thunder just cracked in his mind.

His eyes sharpened, and he spoke in a deep voice, "Explain yourself."

Fredriech demanded, a flicker of desperation igniting in his eyes.

"The Cornolis family ruined your mana core," Josee explained. But as those words entered his ears, another thunder struck Fredriech's mind.

'The Cornolis family?!', Schulga's mouth gaped open. 

'Who?', he thought, 'Who the hell is she?!'

"Normally it would not be possible to restore it," Josee continued, "But I know a way to bring it back."

"How?!" Fredriech shouted, unable to contain his sudden outburst. He rushed forward, almost grabbing Josee's shoulder. But Schulga and the guards reacted quickly, blocking his path.

Realizing his mistake, Fredriech deeply inhaled before apologizing.

"Forgive my rude manners."

"... It's not a problem," Josee rolled her eyes.

"Still. I can't believe you," Fredriech announced, "How can you restore something which can never be restored?"

"A mana core is not a body part that heals. Once it's broken, you destroy your plate, and you can never grow again-"

"... Who says I'm restoring your plate?" Josee smirked.

And that one smirk suddenly sent shivers down Fredriech's spine.

"... Why would I do something so bothersome", and a wicked smile suddenly formed in Josee's face, "When I can just create a new one"

"T-Then, how?!", Fredriech shakily asked.

And with a flick of her hand, a fire emerged from Josee's hands. The guards were suddenly taken aback by that fire, but Schulga remained at his post, warily staring at Fredriech with his right hand on his sword hilt.

Fredriech, however, stared at the flames with deep empty eyes. None of them knew what he was thinking, but a man of his stature can see things that no ordinary mortal can see.

Within his eyes, he saw a fragmented myriad of everlasting dreams. The fires burned with such Light that Fredriech felt his very soul would scald.

'_And when thous't stare into the abyss of the first flame, one will see eternity_', the words of an ancient text repeated in Fredriech's mind.

He suddenly kneeled down, tears flowing down his eyes.

The sudden change in his actions caused the guards, even Schulga, to flinch.

"You...", Fredriech continued, "Who the hell are you?"

"W-Why... w-w-why do you have t-t-those flames. T-Those are p-primordial fla-"

"... The Flames of Cinder", Josee interrupted.

'_... That's right_', Josee thought, '_Although the story was garbage, there was but one character who gave you a glimpse of the true end. A glimpse only an attentive reader can tell amidst the distracting flowery shoujo story_'

'_... Fredriech von Eisenhart. A person who became obsessed with the legend of the Great Cold that would extinguish all fire. Of course, it was talking about the coming of the titans... And the search of Flame_'

Josee stared at him with a kind pity.

'_... A search that killed his master before the story begun_'

"... You're not an idiot", Josee remarked, "Even a broken wizard can tell what is normal and what is not. More so, if they had spent their life in search of Flame"

"Yes. Yes. Yes!", Fredriech raised his hands.

"Please tell me... ", Fredriech asked with such a deep and desperate voice that shivers ran down through the spine of Schulga and the guards.

'_Something's wrong_', Schulga thought, '_Something's really, really wrong_'

He looked at his Lady and begged answers. But her cold eyes were fixated on Fredriech.

"Who are you?", Fredriech asked.

"... Who I am?", Josee coldly replied, "I am the Flame that blazes amidst the Great Cold"

At that moment, Fredriech's mind completely shattered. He immediately kneeled with his forehead facing the ground, and he begged.

"Please! Please take me in! I will do anything you say!"


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


"Is it alright to let him leave just like that?", Schulga warily asked, watching a gray haired man leave their inn from the window.

"... He will return", Josee remarked while reading a dark book in her table.

Their group had returned to the inn. In this humble room, Schulga stood beside the window, watching the movement of everyone below.

"... It's just dealing with a few aggressors. After my flame restored a bit of his powers, its only natural."

"What if he causes a commotion", Schulga asked, "They're aristocrats after all"

"... Doesn't matter", Josee dismissed, "I would have killed them later anyway. Saves me the trouble"

"But... can we trust him?"

"... We will see"

Schulga deeply inhaled.

The sight earlier was something he would never have thought he'd see.

A broken wizard was reborn.

'_The baptism of Flame_', Schulga gulped, '_And basing on what that man says, the implication of my lady's powers are far greater than I ever imagined_'

"My lady", Schulga turned to her.

"... Yes?", Josee casually replied, as a fire-red magic circle formed in her right hand, carefully reading the spell from the magic book.

"How far will your plan go to?"

"... You will know in time", she said. The magic circle in her right hand shattered to pieces. But Josee pushed through and created another one.

"Then let me rephrase my question", Schulga continued, "What will you do to achieve your goal?"

"... Everything", Josee softly answered.

Hearing her reply, Schulga's heart skipped a beat.

'_It seems_', he thought, '_This life of mine, has been caught in something beyond me_'


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


The next day, Josee's group was ready to depart back to Aquel. Before the inn, three more container carriage were added to their group, each filled with barrels after barrels of goods, crops, and other things which Josee ordered Misha to buy for her.

After inspecting them, the group then left Greenleaf Town. The ride went smoothly, and soon they entered the forest between Greenleaf and Aquel.

Before Josee sat a man in gray hair, a light leather armor, and a distinct gray robe of silk color. Josee casually flipped through her notes, reiterating over plans she had made. Beside her is the little maid Misha who is still learning alphabet from her wooden card and chalk.

"Umm", Fredriech wryly opened his mouth, "W-What might be my duty in Aquel, milady?"

"... You're in charge of growing our crops", Josee replied.

"C-Crops?!", Fredriech reacted with surprise.

"... You don't like it?", Josee coldly asked.

"N-No, I just. I have a lot of things I can do, but why crops"

"... Of course, I know your capacity", Josee rolled her eyes, "For now, you will cast growth spurt on regular intervals for seven days each week per harvest on our farm. Aquel is still premature, but later on, once we have more personnel and expanded our operation, you will be in charge of more important matters"

"Understood my lady", Fredriech nodded.

"Consequently, I heard Aquel bordered the Cursed Forest. Would there be trouble from the monsters?"

"... No", Josee replied, "The monsters keep to themselves. If you do enter, don't go too deep, or you'll be facing Demon-class monsters"

Fredriech gulped.

The journey continued.

Josee stared at the list of names in her notebook. Together with those names was a rough map of the kingdom and its surrounding countries.

'_... These are the characters I will have to recruit. Their abilities are too useful to leave to rot. I've got one down, easy enough to recruit_'

But as Josee gave it more thought, the more headache she gets.

'_... The four male leads of the story_', Josee couldn't stop her lips from curling, '_It's true. Each of them are Hero Class monsters capable of facing entire divisions of men. It would be great if I can recruit them but..._'

Josee deeply frowned.

'_... All of them have giant fucking egos. Prideful and domineering, they may appear to respect a woman, but they'll never let one command them_'

Thinking up to his point, Josee felt it was too bothersome to even try.

"... Tsk, I'll just fucking kill them all"

Hearing her, Misha suddenly felt shivers ran down her spine. She moved back, and her face became pale.

Fredriech noticed this change and couldn't help but ask.

'_What the hell did milady do to her?_'


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


"Milady, we're under attack!", the voice of Schulga echoed outside the carriage.

Josee slowly touched her glabella. As the light entered her eyes, she grunted a little. Waking up from her sleep and finding she was under attack was nothing to be pleased at.

Annoyed at the rude awakening, Josee opened the carriage door.

"M-My lady!", Misha panicked, her eyes strutting around everywhere.

"... Stay here", Josee commanded as she closed the door.

The sun was dyed a shade of orange. It was just only one more kilometer before they reach Aquel. As Josee looked around, she noticed that a group of 50 or so men surrounded them. Wearing rough clothing and patched armors made out of any bits and scraps they could find, Josee realized they truly were the cliché'd bandits of novels.

"My lady!", Schulga tightly held his steel sword. The ten guards surrounded the carriage, their sweat poured out of their body as they trembled from the tension.

Josee turned around and to her left, Fredriech was quietly casting a magic circle on his hands, hidden in his back.

Thinking about this, Josee decided to do something similar. A magic circle appeared beneath the soles of her leather shoe.

"Oh great noble!", a bandit stepped forward. He carried a giant, scimitar and proudly announced. Of all the bandits, only he had decent looking plate armor.

"Hand over the goods, crates, and gold, and I'll let you all live!", the bandit announced.

Hearing those words, Josee's arms shivered, barely enduring the cringe.

"... Fredriech", Josee whispered, "Can you cast protection spells to the guards?"

"I can", Fredriech promptly replied.

"... Good. Do it on my signal. Schulga, focus on protecting the goods with the guards. Fredriech and I will deal with them"

But seeing them ignore him, veins popped in the bandit leader's face.

"What the fuck are you guys whispering about?! Men! Capture that woman!"

"... Now", Josee signalled.

Quickly, Fredriech realigned the magic circle in his hand and light orbs bounced to the ten guards and Schulga, enveloping them in a subtle green light.

Josee raised her arms forward and an instant burst of Flame emerged, burning at least twenty men. 

'_No casting?!_', Fredriech exclaimed in shock.

"ARGHh!"

"FIRE! Fire!"

"Help!"

With great ferocity, Josee immediately appeared before the burning bandit leader and stabbed her sword through his head, instantly killing him. The other bandits, unable to react in time were suddenly entangled by vines and leaves.

"Tsk!", Fredriech gnashed his teeth, seeing he only managed to entangle 8 of them.

Finally reacting at the chaos, the remaining two dozen bandits fought back and tangled with the guards.

Schulga fought bravely. As a trained knight, he easily slashed through three bandits.

"The knight's too strong! Kill the mag-", one of the bandit shouted before a sword dug deep into his heart. Josee pushed him aside and threw another wave of fire, killing six other men.

The guards struggled fighting. With their buckler and spears, they kept the bandits from approaching, stabbing and slashing, and yet none of their attacks dealt any real damage.

Josee walked around the perimeter with casualness. Any bandit that stood in her way were either burned or stabbed. She approached the entangled men and immediately burned them all to ash.

And so, with blazing fire, the fifty or so bandits were reduced to mere five.

"Run!"

They scattered in all directions.

"... Fredriech", Josee softly commanded.

"Yes!", casting a green magic circle, Fredriech entangled the five fleeing bandits.

After two minutes, the battle immediately ended. Schulga stared in shock at the sheer power Josee showed. His eyes shivering at what he had seen.

'_She's like a walking, living sun. Even back in the royal capital, no mage could cast such furious fire with ease and power_', Once more, Schulga gulped down.

"... Are there anyone injured?", Josee walked around the carriages, inspecting the damages.

"No milady!", the guard's Captain, Anthony shouted, "We're all fine!"

"... Good. Stab the dead bandits. Make sure they're dead", Josee cruelly commanded before walking back to Fredriech and Schulga.

"Yes!", the guards shouted in unison. Their bodies shivered, and the blood rushed through their quickly beating heart. They do not understand why and how their lady possess such great power, but they were glad she was on their side.

Hearing her utter such a cruel command, Fredriech was taken aback.

While a magic circle rotated in his hand, he glanced at Schulga and whispered.

"Is she always this cruel?", Fredriech asked with sweat in his forehead.

"It's complicated", Schulga replied. For even, he, wasn't entirely sure what happened.

As Josee approached Schulga, she noticed a bandit on the ground move their hands. Bringing her sword, Josee stabbed its head, spluttering blood in the ground. Flame then burst in her sword, evaporating the blood before sheathing it in her scabbard.

Josee calmly stared at Fredriech.

He saw her furrowed eyebrows. Despite the heat from the flames, a cold sweat poured through his forehead.

"... Can you bring the remaining bandits here?", Josee asked.

"Y-Yes. Yes I can", Fredriech stuttered, staring at the ash filled ground. 

'_It just instantly turned them to ash. So this is the power of Flame_', A sense of dread filled his mind.

With a wave of his hand, the root veins brought the five bandits over. Standing in rows, their eyes were shivering in fear.

"... Let this one talk", Standing before one of them, Josee commanded.

Fredriech then untangled the mouth of that bandit. A middle-aged man with a mustache, a brown skin, and a frail yet muscular body.

"... Why did you attack us?", Josee asked.

"I-I, We-we", the man stuttered.

"... You're wasting my time", Josee rolled her eyes, and with great disregard, burned the man alive. His screams could not be heard as he died on spot.

The remaining four began crying, their empty eyes were filled with nothing but despair.

Both Fredriech and Schulga frowned, but they kept their silence.

Josee stood at the man next to the previous bandit who was now ash. Signaling Fredriech, he opened the bandit's mouth.

"W-We were tipped!", the bandit, no older than 30, rapidly spoke, "We scout Greenleaf town for any easy target with large amount of goods! W-We saw you and thought it'd be an easy hit since its just one Knight and ten guards!"

The bandit hurriedly explained with such speed that he ended up biting his tongue. He grimaced in pain and remained quiet.

"... I see", Josee coldly noted, "And where is your hideout?"

"T-That", but as the bandit hesitated, Josee sighed and merely burned him.

"... Waste of time. You", Josee beckoned another bandit.

After obtaining all the information she needed, Josee burned all men to death, leaving nothing but ash behind. After her interrogation, the guard's captain, Anthony came to report.

"Milady! We've confirmed all men are dead!", Anthony reported. His old brigandine armor was splattered with blood.

"... I see", Josee softly nodded. Her half-closed eyes then coldly stared at Fredriech.

"... Fredriech. How is your mana circle?"

"Hm? Ah! Yes, it's going well. I've successfully stabilized my first circle. It shouldn't take me more than a week to reach the second circle"

"... Good", Josee replied before walking back to where the dead bodies were.

"... Prepare wind magic. We must clean the scene and leave no evidence", she ordered as a flame grew from her hands.

"Yes!", Fredriech obediently shouted.

'_Fuck, Fuck, Fuck, Fuck_', Fredriech cursed in his head.

'_What kind of Lunatic did I get myself employed to?_'

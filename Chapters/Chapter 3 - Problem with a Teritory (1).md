**Chapter 3  - Problem with a Territory**

After talking with the carpenters and blacksmiths, Josee had another headache.

'_... They're using hand measurements. Oh my god_' she sat at her office table, pinching her glabella.

'_... The length of a hand, a foot, or fingers. This simply will not do. For my future projects, I cannot allow that to happen._' Josee stood up from her table with a deep frown on her face.

'_... If I don't fix this now, it'll be a fucking mess later. But I can't recreate the metric system. Not with my clunky memory. I will need a potion._'

She looked at the room where only Schulga was left behind.

'_... First, I will have to directly inspect the territory._'

"... Prepare the carriage," Josee commanded.

"Yes" Schulga replied, "Where might we be heading, milady?"

"... Village."

◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

A humble carriage walked through the middle of the humble village of Aquel, drawn by a malnourished horse.

As the dust from the dirt road was kicked into the air by the carriage, the villagers standing around stared at the carriage. Though it was humble and crestless, an old and almost shabby carriage, everyone in the village knew to whom it belonged.

The Baron's Daughter.

The carriage stopped in the village center. Opening the door, a maid came out and held the door for Josee, who carried her own umbrella.

She wore a long red skirt, a long-sleeved white shirt, a leather corset, and a white capelet on her shoulder. Putting her arms to the back, she caressed her buttocks.

'... I endured it last time, but goddamn, that's a fucking uncomfortable piece of shit carriage. I'll have to commission the blacksmith to build me a suspension system.'

Her crimson eyes scanned the surroundings. The village houses were small timber-framed structures carrying thatched roofs. The whitewash covering the walls was filled with many random woods, hammered to hide the holes in it. Many houses had missing roofs, covered by large leaves; most were just shanty houses built from scavenged scrap woods.

Josee observed the busy village. Many of the men were busy hammering at the walls and roofs. On the sides of the houses, Josee noted the fences in each house, sometimes in the front yard, others in the backyard. The women were inside those fences, carrying baskets of food scraps or foraged green stuff to feed the chickens or pigs in their backyards. But the number of their livestock was only two or three.

"Wah, it's the baron's daughter!" a group of children approached Josee. They were wearing humble tunics made of linen.

'... Blue, Red, Yellow, beige. Their clothing has a surprising variety' Josee noted as the kids surrounded her.

"Hey! Hey, what are you doing here?"

"Do you have snacks?"

"Milady, come play with us!"

Josee half-closed her eyes. Seeing the playful energy of these five children, Josee felt tired all of a sudden.

Behind her, Schulga came down from the carriage driver's seat, and Misha, the young maid, quietly stood behind.

"... Misha," Josee commanded, "Give the children some snacks."

"Ah, yes!" the brown-haired young maid bowed before going to the carriage and opening a compartment underneath the seats.

"... I have no time to play," Josee softly replied to the children.

"... That maid will give you snacks," she pointed to Misha inside the carriage.

"Snacks? Yay!"

"Thank you, milady!"

"You're so nice!"

Josee stepped aside as the children left to surround the young Misha.

Walking through the village, Josee noticed how near the port was. Many villagers turned to look at her, and a lot of them waved their hands to say hello.

"Oh, milady," a hunched old lady, wearing a humble brown tunic, waved her hands.

Josee turned to her and nodded.

Walking beside her, Schulga simply observed Josee's actions. His right hand was placed on the sword at his hip.

Finally arriving near the port, Josee stopped and ruminated. It was a port made of stones cut into pieces and glued together using mortar. On the dock, where many boats were being repaired or built at the moment, Josee saw a lot of men walking around, bringing wood, nails, and hammering.

'... Single mast, two sails. If I remember correctly, those are called Shallop boats.'

Suddenly, a guard stopped before Josee and lightly bowed.

"Milady," the middle-aged guard spoke.

Josee looked at him and nodded.

"... Is there anything I should know? How's the security?"

"We've been patrolling the village, and so far, there haven't been any pirate sightings," the guard reported.

'... Pirates' Josee frowned.

'... Fuck. Josee from the noble life only cared about simping over handsome princes at the academy. And you're telling me there were actually pirates in her territory? Fuck.'

'... Then again, this place is riddled with monsters.'

Suddenly, a commotion emerged. Josee turned toward the port and saw the men had stopped what they were doing. They stared at the horizon and saw a boat approaching them. From that distance, they saw that one of the boat's sails had a huge hole in it.

Josee's crimson eyes suddenly grew brighter as a spark of ember flowed through them like water. Her eyes zoomed in on the men in that boat, and she saw that they were injured.

Schulga watched from the side, his eyes bulging wide at the change in Josee's eyes.

"... Tsk," Josee deeply frowned.

She turned to the guardsman and, with urgency in her voice, ordered:

"... Get the wise women and the church priest. Those men are injured."

"Huh?" the guard raised his eyebrows, turning around and looking at the distance.

"You can see from that far, milady?"

"... I gave you an order," Josee coldly replied.

"Ah! Yes!" surprised, the guard immediately ran through the village to get the people Josee needed.

After five minutes, the Shallop boat arrived, carrying five men who were bruised and injured. The men at the port panicked and hurriedly carried the men to the docks, laying them on the ground.

As soon as the men were placed on the dock, the guard from earlier came back. He brought six women and the local priest, who saw the situation and hurriedly aided the injured men.

"Bring us alcohol!" one of the wise women, an old grandma, shouted at the men standing on the side, who immediately ran toward their houses.

Josee watched as the six women opened the boxes they carried. She observed how they assessed the men's injuries and immediately took linen clothes to start cleaning the wounds.

"Gah! Damn bloody pirates!" one of the injured men groaned.

"Rogar, I told you we should have given our fish," another injured man spoke.

"And what? Starve our families? We can't burn through the lord's grains; we'd starve!" argued the man named Rogar.

Moments later, Josee turned to one of the men watching on the side and asked:

"... You, how often does this happen?" Josee asked.

"Ah, Milady. Hmm? Your eyes are red?" the villager wondered.

"... Answer my question," Josee frowned.

"Ah, yes, well," the man scratched his head, "Not really often. Though it sometimes happens every year. It's when we venture too far into pirate territory east. There's plenty of fish there, undisturbed by Cetarax, but filled with pirates."

"... I see," Josee nodded.

'... These men must have been desperate. They dared to venture into dangerous waters due to the lack of fish in the area.'

Josee then turned and looked at the local priest. He was a middle-aged man with a goatee, wearing a dark robe and beads. He was casting some healing spell. His forehead was sweating as a small magic circle of yellow light appeared in his hands.

"... Schulga," Josee spoke.

"Yes, milady?"

"... Remind me what that spell is."

"The Rejuvenating spell," Schulga replied. But his eyes flinched at Josee's question.

"It boosts the patient's health, makes them heal faster."

"... But it does not actually heal them?"

"No. Father Pedran only knows a few low-level spells," Schulga clarified.

"... I see."

'... This Cetarax is causing too much headache' Josee's eyes sharpened.

Josee felt the caress of the strong wind from the sea. Standing on top of the stone seaport, she watched as strange birds flew through the sky.

'... I will have to personally butcher that lobster myself' Josee coldly remarked.

A jar of alcohol finally arrived. The wise women each applied it to the slash wounds and bruises of the injured men, cleaning them in the process.

'... It's the sole reason why this territory is poor. A strategic location given its proximity to the kingdom to the south, and yet unusable.'

Josee deeply sighed.

'... Once the path is opened, the Kalingrad Barony will be the new trading hub between the two kingdoms. After all, it's much more economical than directing your ship 40 more kilometers north.'

A memory suddenly flashed through Josee's mind. The realization caused her eyes to open wide.

"... Ah, that's right..."

'... The fucking crown prince goes to war with the Southern Kingdom over the heroine, a mere woman. Then, after slaughtering the royal family, he crippled their economy...'

Josee began having a headache. She started biting her thumbnail. Seeing this, Schulga frowned.

'... He made the common populace suffer over the sin of a single man. Jesus fucking Christ, that insane lunatic! AHHHHHHH! If the southern kingdom gets crippled, where am I gonna get business?!'

It was at this moment when Josee finally decided to mark the prince as one of her future "targets."

'... I will fucking kill him.'

Afterwards, Josee interviewed a few more men before leaving the area. As she rode through the carriage, Schulga quietly observed her.

◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

By the south of the village of Aquel was a humble patch of land. In this place, a different industry existed.

Salt Farmers.

Josee stepped down into the field, seeing a flat land filled with dozens of salt farmers. They carried buckets of saltwater before pouring them into square flats of land where someone would rake the water to create an even elevation.

The salt farms were situated a few hundred meters from the village and the beach.

"Milady," Schulga spoke, "It's dirty and hot in here. A noble lady like you sh-"

"... I do not care," Josee cut him off, causing Schulga to keep quiet.

As Josee observed them from the edge of the salt farm with an umbrella in her right hand, someone suddenly approached her.

It was a farmer in his mid-40s. His skin had become dark from the constant sunlight. Wearing faded dark blue trousers, the man bowed before Josee.

"It's a pleasure to meet the baron's young lady," the sweating farmer smiled.

"May I inquire as to your visit?" the farmer lightly smiled. Seeing his sweat, Josee frowned.

"... Tsk. Misha, give this man a cup of water."

"Ahh? Y-Yes!" Hurriedly, Misha ran inside the carriage, where she took a cup of water from the barrel inside. Running back, she gave it to the farmer, who smiled and gladly drank it.

"Ah, thank you for the water, my lady!" the man brightly smiled.

As Josee looked over the field, the hard labor of poor peasants, a sudden idea popped into her head.

"... How's the salt production?" Josee asked.

"Hmm? Do you mean the amount, milady?"

"... Yes," Josee softly replied.

"Well, it is sufficient to supply this village—two dozen bags of salt. We sell the excess to the traveling caravan each month." Josee then nodded.

"... What's it like farming salt?"

"Making salt is laborious work," the salt farmer swiped the sweat off his face. "You have to keep watch over the fields and make sure no animal comes to disturb it. And when it rains, it washes the salt away. So we can only farm during certain seasons and pray that Aerasyl grants us good wind."

"... And the hardest part of the work?" Josee asked.

"We, ugh, we have to always carry buckets of seawater to the fields whenever the water evaporates, so that we can get as much salt per flat," the farmer raised his eyebrows. He didn't understand why a noble lady wanted to hear about the work of a peasant.

"... I see... and... Your allegiance... it is sworn to my father?" she coldly asked.

"Yes," the man shakily nodded.

"... and my father... owns these lands, hence he owns these farms, yes?"

"Y-Yes?", the man stuttered, this time, he felt something was wrong. He tried to read her mood, but Josee remained emotionless.

"... I see," she then began walking around the salt farm's perimeter. For ten minutes, Josee just walked around the whole farm. The salt farmers looked at her with weird eyes. What was a well-dressed woman doing in their muddy farm?

As Josee finished surveying the lands, she returned to her carriage and immediately left.

The salt farmer was left there, standing with widened eyes. He felt like he was about to lose his job.

◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

The carriage drove through the village. As the sun began setting, the villagers began gathering and retreating back to their homes. The fishermen anchored their boats, the women returned their livestock to their pens, and the guards changed shifts, diligently patrolling the village.

In her carriage, Josee sat with crossed legs.

In front of her, a knight in steel armor sat with crossed arms and a serious look on his face.

Josee merely closed her eyes, lost in her own thoughts.

As Schulga stared at her, the white-haired man finally opened his mouth.

"Milady," an incomparable seriousness filled his face, "Why have you drastically changed from your 1-week coma?"

As those words entered her ears, Josee slowly opened her crimson eyes. The warm orange light entering through the windows gave an almost ethereal shade.

Thinking for a moment, she stared back at Schulga without an ounce of hesitation.

"... A god revealed unto me... knowledge."

"What?", Schulga frowned.

He then opened his mouth and asked, "Which god?" Schulga questioned.

"..."

"..."

"... Why would I tell you?" Josee asked with cold eyes looking down on Schulga.

Hearing her response, Schulga deeply frowned.

And after a few moments, he finally spoke.

"You... you're not Josephine Kalingrad... are you," he growled in a deep voice. Schulga subconsciously held the handle of his sword.

As Josee saw this, her half-closed, cold eyes lazily glared at Schulga.

"... What makes you say that?" Josee asked.

"You asked questions. A lot of them. Things the real Josee Kalingrad should have known," Schulga spoke deeply.

"And you've been acting weird. The real Josee is not this domineering. She's a cheerful and innocent noble lady. You're too smart and ruthless," Schulga tightly gripped the hilt of his sword.

"I don't know who you are, but if you've done something to the real Jose-"

"... And what are you going to do? Hmm?" Josee cut him off.

"... Kill me?" she merely glared at him.

Schulga flinched. He deeply frowned and gnashed his teeth.

"If I must."

"... ", Josee paused for a few seconds before a smirk appeared on her face.

"... No. I'm the real Josee."

"And how can you prove that?"

Josee opened her eyes once more. Slowly, a cold light came off her eyes.

"... You told me you were a bastard son of the Redonis Household, remember?"

Schulga's eyes then slowly widened.

"... Back when I was 10 years old," Josee softly smiled, "... I remember."

"... Still, I know it's shocking to see a huge transformation in such a short time," Josee flipped her brown hair with her right hand.

"... But falling from a horse is not sufficient for one to go into a coma. And it's not even a running horse," Josee tilted her head, resting it in her right hand.

"Then," Schulga gulped, "What exactly happened?"

"..." Josee glanced at the setting sun. The quiet moment made her remember the memories of her past life.

"... I had experienced an entirely different life," Josee spoke. And slowly, her humble dress became engulfed in embers.

The Flames of Cinder blazed gently around Josee. It burned quietly, and yet, it did not harm the wood nor Schulga.

As Schulga saw those flames, his eyes widened.

"That fire," Schulga gulped, "That's not... magic, is it?"

"... No," Josee responded, "It is not."

"... The life I experienced on the other side, I would not wish to speak of it. But..."

Josee's eyes became filled with melancholy.

"It... changed me, in many ways. Taught me things. I saw things. Well... it's all in the past now."

And as Schulga watched the empty look within Josee's eyes, a sense of dread filled his heart.

'... That stare, that's the stare of someone who had seen... horrors. I've seen old knights with a stare like that.'

"Lady Josephine," Schulga removed his hands from his sword handle.

"This... thing you experienced. Will there be more to it? What happened?"

"... Worry not," Josee glanced back at Schulga.

"... The dream is over. And I had been granted knowledge no man should have. I know your loyalty, Schulga. I can trust you. But I cannot tell anyone what I had seen.... or there will be consequences."

"Consequences?" Schulga frowned. His legs tapped the floor of the moving carriage.

"... Yes," Josee stared right into his eyes.

"... Consequences," Josee bit her lips. Her crimson eyes downcast.

As he heard the grave voice of his lady, a voice that almost sounded desperate, Schulga gnashed his teeth.

"Milady!" Schulga announced.

"I am here. I will fight for you and protect you from anything that comes! No matter what it is, my life is yours!" Schulga spoke with a passionate, brave voice.

"... I know," Josee softly replied.

"... I still remember when I strayed off to the Cursed Forest. You protected me from a giant Serpent," Josee lightly smiled.

"Milady."

"... It's good I haven't forgotten that."

"Well," Schulga lightly smiled, "You were quite the rebellious daughter back then."

"... Hmph," Josee giggled.

"Milady," Schulga then bowed his head.

"I apologize for my transgression earlier. I promise it will not happen again."

"... Think nothing of it. Your worries were warranted," Josee nodded, retracting her fire inside.

A moment of silence passed them by. And as the carriage neared the small family mansion, Schulga opened his mouth again.

"But milady, for what purpose were your... knowledge given?"

"... An enemy will come," Josee spoke with a deep frown on her face.

Seeing the changes, Schulga also frowned.

"What enemy, milady?"

"... A powerful one. Unimaginably so. That's why we need power. And to recruit allies. I will make this town prosper; it will be the base of our operations."

"... We must be ready for the coming battle," and Josee turned towards Schulga.

"... We might all die."

◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

The three moons of this world hung high in the night sky. Josee quietly sat at the table in her room, with a humble candle lamp lighting the parchment. A few notes and designs were scribbled on it.

She wore her white nightgown, a dress Josee preferred because it was chilly and comfortable.

'... It's good Josephine was all bubbles and retardation in the head, leaving me a diary to pick up her memories' Josee recalled her conversation with Schulga.

'... No matter. If it worked or not, a knight is replaceable. Anyway, the first matter of things I have to settle is the food.'

Josee tapped the quill in her hand.

'... Unless I fix the warding stone issue, we can't expand usable land nor get wood. Half the houses are still broken. The area between here and the salt farms was rocky and mountainous, not suitable for farming.'

Josee then glanced outside the window.

'... Not only that, this place really isn't suitable for farming. It regularly receives powerful storms.'

'... Which means we can only farm vertically in a sheltered place.'

Josee continued tapping her hands.

"... Fortunately, I studied hydroponics. I can make a primitive version, but it'll require some testing of multiple batches of crops."

'... Which means we're still back to the issue at hand. Food in the short-term. It's unlikely I'll grow these in one month's time' Josee laid back at her table.

As she thought of many possibilities, an idea suddenly came to her mind.

"... Oh... right," Josee calmly thought.

'... I can just recruit a slave to use magic on the crops. That should do it. And... can't we just eat the meat from the Cursed Forest?'

Josee considered for a moment, then she wrote that down.

"... I'll ask Schulga later."

She bit the end of her quill as she processed the information in her head.

"... But while I'm building my hydroponics farm, I need to create cement. The houses are made of wood, but with the limited supply, it's inefficient. I believe I saw a rocky quarry in the Cursed Forest."

'... Which only leaves me one more issue... the warding stone.'

Josee fiddled with the quill with her fingers.

"... Hmm. Then I'll need to enter a certain cove of an ancient alchemist, which... coincidentally is located in..."

Josee picked up a map of the world rolled over at the side of her table. Uncurling it, she saw the Kingdom of Brytoria, where her territory was positioned.

Seated at the southernmost part of the Kingdom, facing the sea, Josee traced her hands to the east filled with many islands.

"... The pirate's heaven," Josee half-closed her eyes.

'... The warding stone was just a side treasure. The heroine was kidnapped here, again, by the Pirate King and was rescued by the male leads.'

'... Why the fuck does every fucker in the world want to have sex with her? Christ...'

"... I'll first need to get a large ship. Luckily, I can just steal it. What's important is a crew. Then after attacking the pirate's cove, I'll turn over their heads to each nearby country for a price and quickly leave, doubling my loot."

Josee deeply inhaled and exhaled...

"... I must accomplish this within one month. That's decided. Now then, let's design that hydroponics.... Fuck, I need to get a ruler first."

And on that night, Josee ordered the servants to bring her wooden planks and carving tools. She first began making a dependable metric ruler, with the conversion methods written on a paper.

It was rough and inaccurate compared to the true metric system, but it was sufficient for its intended purpose. After creating two copies, Josee was satisfied.

And as a true engineer who had to suffer through college, Josee completely disregarded the English measurement system.

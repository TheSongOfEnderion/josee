# Chapter 9  - Free City of Galile

Several days passed, and Josee poured all her focus into managing Aquel's reconstruction.

As a mechanical engineer, civil engineering wasn't exactly Josee's forte. While she grasped the concepts of loads and moments of force, applying them to buildings instead of machine parts was a different story altogether.

Frustrated by her limited construction knowledge, Josee came to a decision: construct temporary housing for the villagers, to be demolished later when a competent civil engineer could be found.

With Friedrich's contribution of a steady food supply, Josee's cement production, and the occasional hunt for meat from large beasts, the village's basic needs were met.

The rocky shores of Aquel proved advantageous, providing readily available stone for construction.

Thus, on the fourth day, the first concrete house in the village stood complete. This initial project served as a learning experience for the village carpenters, who then embarked on the construction of twenty more houses.


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


The next day, a visitor arrived at Josee's office in the mansion.  Josee was surprised Schulga's friend had come so quickly.

The man was wiry, with scraggly hair and a cheap outfit: a dark rose jacket over a white long-sleeve shirt and a bow tie paired with ill-fitting dark brown leather pants.

"Good afternoon, milady," the man greeted with a bow. "I am Bolli of the West Wing Merchant Company."

Schulga stood beside him, eyeing his friend he hadn't seen in years with a hint of suspicion.

"Hmmm," Josee murmured, tapping the desk. Dressed in her usual simple red dress, she studied Bolli. "...My name is Josephine Kalingrad of the Kalingrad Barony. Let's dispense with formalities. You arrived fast."

Josee estimated it should have taken at least three days to travel by boat from the capital city to Aquel.  Yet, here he was, a day early, in a damaged ship.

"Clearly, you used a wind stone to speed up your trip," she deduced.

"Well," Bolli began, launching into a fawning introduction, "Schulga here told me about a great opportunity. He's an excellent knight, a man of impeccable character, I assure you. Hahahaha—"

"You're in debt, aren't you?" Josee cut him off, rolling her eyes at his transparent flattery.

A bead of sweat trickled down Bolli's back. "Ah, what makes you say that, milady?"

"Look," Josee said with steely eyes, "neither of us is stupid. The sooner you're honest, the faster we can make a deal."

Bolli forced another laugh. "Schulga, your lady certainly makes an impression!"

Schulga, however, simply shook his head and sighed. "My apologies, milady. I knew this fellow was a gambler, but he used to be a competent merchant. Now, though..." He cast Bolli a pitying look.

"H-Hey, Schulga!" Bolli sputtered. "It wasn't my fault! That wretched woman got me into debt!"

Josee watched the exchange, then shook her head. "...This won't do. I can't do business with someone like you."

"W-Wait, milady!" Bolli pleaded, raising a hand. "The letter you wrote only requires selling your crops to the Free City of Galile, right?" A sly grin stretched across his face. "I have connections there. I can easily sell the shipment and turn a good profit!"

"Hmmm," Josee mused, steepling her fingers.

"Before we go any further," Schulga interjected, "Bolli, who did you borrow money from?"

Bolli averted his gaze.

This prompted Josee to delve into her memories. Something niggled at her, but she couldn't quite place it. Pulling open a drawer, she retrieved her journal and began flipping through the pages.

Schulga noticed her flipping through the notebook and caught a glimpse of the letters within. 'What are those? Ancient runes?' he wondered.

Josee stopped abruptly. "...Oh," she sighed in realization.

Putting the notebook down, she clasped her hands again. "...I will not be trading with you," she declared, fixing Bolli with a cold stare.

"A-Ah, but why?" Bolli stammered, his bravado faltering.

"You're wasting my time," Josee snapped. "A merchant in trouble is not a good partner. If you want to do business with me, I need evidence that your future value outweighs your current problems."

Bolli slumped in defeat. He looked at Josee with weary eyes. Before coming here, he'd envisioned a fresh start, escaping his troubles by trading at sea. 'A letter from my friend seemed like the perfect opportunity,' he thought. 'A young noblewoman with a large amount of crops. What could go wrong?'

Clearly, he'd underestimated her. The seemingly innocent girl before him exuded the aura of a seasoned politician, impervious to his pleas.

"My problems are under control," Bolli insisted. "I got into debt with the Brytoria Mercantile Association."

Schulga's frown deepened. "I thought you were running from loan sharks. What happened?"

"That's the thing," Bolli replied, meeting Schulga's gaze. "The Brytoria Mercantile Association changed leadership. They've become more predatory, less regulatory. They target anyone who refuses to join their association. Gambling and a certain woman landed me in hot water with them."

"Bolli," Schulga said with an exasperated sigh, "haven't I always told you to stop thinking with your lower half?"

"Shit, how was I supposed to know she was the lion's den?!"

"... Hmmm", Josee lightly raised her eyebrows. Recalling her notes, she remembered the Brytoria Mercantile Association's recent power grab.

'... Right, they felt threatened by the rising King of Gold, one of the male leads, from the western Empire, thus they started consolidating power and trade routes'

'... Eventually, I will have to clash with them', Josee tapped her fingers.

'... If I remember correctly, the King of Gold will soon establish the first true banks in this world. Currently associations fills that role in a pseudo manner like doing insurance and lending money, but only to merchants and sailors'

A wicked grin spread across Josee's face, sending shivers down the spines of the two men before her.

"Alright, Bolli," Josee said, her crimson gaze locking with his. "Here's what I really need to know. Can you break inside the Brytoria Mercantile Association undetected?"

"What?!" Bolli and Schulga exclaimed in unison.

"Milady, that's far too dangerous!" Schulga protested. "The Association wields immense power, enough to sway the King himself! They have hundreds of mages at their disposal!"

Josee chuckled coldly. "Who says I'm the one going in?"

Ignoring their stunned expressions, Josee turned back to her parchment and began writing.

Bolli considered her proposition for a moment, his brow furrowed in concentration. Finally, he spoke.

"I can do it," he said grimly. "I know how to get inside."

"Excellent," Josee replied. "Now, let's talk about this trade deal."


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

Uncertainty flickered across Josee's face as she stood by the window, gazing out at the bustling village. 

"... Can he be trusted?"

Escorted by Alex, Bolli had just left to inspect the goods. By the window, Josee watched the bustling village, the men, energized by the new materials, had abandoned fishing to focus on rebuilding. They hauled limestone and other supplies, while the women toiled over communal meals to fuel their efforts.

"Bolli might seem a bit rough around the edges, milady," Schulga said with a sigh. "But he's got a good heart. He spends his money freely, but only on two things: women and the less fortunate. That's why we're friends."

Josee snorted. "Especially women, it seems."

Schulga chuckled sheepishly. "Unfortunately, yes. But milady," his voice grew serious, "what's this about breaking into the Association?"

"I'll explain when the time comes," Josee said, turning to face him. Her gaze held a steely glint. "In the meantime, call Nadia and have her prepare travel clothes for both of us. We're accompanying Bolli to the Free City of Galile."


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

The vast expanse of the world's blue ocean stretched before Josee. The salty wind whipped her brown hair back, revealing a determined glint in her eyes. Dressed in an unassuming beige dress, she stood at the ship's bow, a sharp sword hanging from her hip – a stark contrast to her commoner's attire.

"We'll need to make a detour because of Cetarax," Boli explained, adjusting his worn jacket and leather pants. "Word has it the beast woke up and devoured a whole ship."

Schulga, clad in dark blue leather armor that accentuated his wind-tousled white ponytail, scoffed. "Nonsense. If a ship went down, we'd know about it."

Bolli scratched his beard sheepishly. "Just rumors, then?"

Josee remained silent, her gaze fixed on the churning water.

"Milady", Schulga turned around and saw the dozens of villagers that their ship carried.

"Was there really a need to bring this many workers with us?"

"... Oh, trust me", Josee fixed her hair from the wind's    

Her mind filled with a singular purpose: vanquishing Cetarax. The memory of her fiery transformation, wielding flames like metal, fueled her resolve.

'If I can sustain that form for an hour, I have a fighting chance,' she strategized. 'But merely slaying it is wasteful. I need a powerful enemy to fall with it. That thing's casual firepower can level an entire town'

The journey to the Free City of Galile, originally planned for one day, stretched into two due to the detour caused by Cetarax. While Bolli yawned and Schulga fended off his overly curious questions about their crops, Josee retreated to her makeshift cabin office.

Unfurling parchments, she sketched her plans. 

'Resources - mages and manpower. Spring is nearing its end, and summer's on the horizon. By winter, I must reach the Cursed Forest and build a wall to contain the rampaging monsters.'

Her eyes drifted to another drawing on her desk: an exploded view of a steam engine, meticulously detailed – pistons, cylinders, belts, boilers – yet with a hint of imperfection in certain areas.

'I need bronze and steel,' she thought. 'With a few small mana stones and Friedrich's fire rune expertise, this machine could run indefinitely.'

A mischievous glint sparked in her eyes as she switched parchments, revealing a mechanical blueprint of a rifle. Setting it aside, she retrieved two metal strips. With a surge of heat, her hands transformed the metal into glowing red bars. Pressing them together, she focused on their contact point, welding them with intense heat.

Satisfied, she plunged the metal into a bucket of water. A hiss and a puff of steam erupted as the metal cooled. Inspecting the welded joint, however, she frowned. Tiny cracks marred the surface, betraying her calculation.

"Hmm. A touch too hot," she muttered, shrugging. Melting the metal down once more, she formed small spheres to practice her temperature control. As the journey continued, Josee persevered, honing her ability to manipulate heat.

◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

A sliver of light peeked through the window, rousing Friedrich from his sleep in the Kalingrad mansion. Though small, his room provided warmth and comfort.

After a quick wash with water magic and a drying spell, Friedrich donned his usual attire – a long green linen shirt and brown trousers – and pulled on the dark coat gifted by the Lady Kalingrad.

His day began at the sprawling warehouse overflowing with crops, a testament to their initial success. More beds had been added, and a team of ten villagers now tended to them full-time, handling the nutrient solution, seedlings, and harvests. Another group gathered raw materials.

Around ten villagers helped in full-time with mixing the nutritional liquid, pouring them into the beds, placing the sapplings, and harvesting them. A different group of villagers were then responsible for collecting raw material. All Fredrich had to do was cast growth spell over and over again that he had practically gotten bored with it, activating the spell without much thought.

Whenever Friedrich looked at the bountiful harvest that appears every 3 minutes, he couldn't help but shook his head.

"A completely unorthodox method. Who would have thought of using a mage, and a wizard at that, for such menial task?"

In Friedrich's world, magic served two primary purposes: unraveling the cosmos' mysteries or wielding devastating power in war. Magic was notoriously difficult to learn and master, making it a symbol of nobility and power throughout many kingdoms. Yet, after spending a few days in Aquel, Friedrich's traditional mindset began to crack under the influence of Josephine Kalingrad.

Nothing is beyond her violation. Anything and Everything that can and will be of use to the fullfillment of a purpose will and shall be used.

To use such powerful and grand beings as mere tools of production was a way of thinking that shattered Fredrich's traditional mindset. Initially, he could not fathom such disrespect. But after learning of the bounty of josee's innovation did he realize he was wrong the whole time.

But it didn't stop there, Josee even asked to use runes to burn mere stones. Friedrich couldn't take it, but after considering her proposition and the result of the concrete houses did he finally realized.

Josee was no mere cruel noble. She was an Inventor, and a genius one at that.

'Perhaps that's the reason why the First Flame chose her?', Friedrich thought as he cast another growth spell to a batch of wheats.

"Oh. Is sir mage here?", an old and creeky voice came from the entrance of the warehouse.

Friedrich turned towards the wide door and saw an old village lady wearing a yellow-brown village dress.

"Hoo, sir mage", the old lady walked forward and handed Fredrich a basket filled with sandwich with meat inside them and lettuce leafs.

"Ah, No", Friedrich was caught off guard, causing him to cancel the casting of growth spell.

"I-I don't need", Friedrich opened and closed his mouth, his eyes flustered at the sudden gift.

"Haha, no need to be shy", the old wrinkled lady smiled brightly. 

"It's just my way of thanking you for making us so many crops. My dear Ellen was able to eat fresh vegetables because of you. We no longer have to worry about hunger"

"Oh", Upon hearing her words, Fredrich's dark and terrible eyes momentarily shined a humble glint.

"Then. Thank you", Fredrich nodded.

"Haha, no, thank you sir mage. I'll be going then", the old lady turned around and slowly began walking back to the village.

Around him, the ten workers, men of all ages looked at the quiet back of Friedrich. They smiled warmly at the unsocial mage before continuing their work.

Friedrich has always kept to himself. When people tried to talk to him, he simply nodded and continued moving. To Friedrich, all that mattered was that he regained his 6th Circle Wizard status as soon as he can and to figure more about the Great Cold whose pursuit killed his master.

He placed his hand inside the basket, slowly picking a sandwich and taking a bite.

It wasn't the most delicious sandwich in the world, nor was it made with the highest of quality of ingredients, food which Friedrich grew accustomed with.

And yet, this humble sandwich made him feel warmth in his cold frozen heart.

Friedrich gulped down before staring back at the sandwich.

"It taste good"

◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

The Light of Dawn emerged in the Free City of Galile.

A major hub filled with hundreds of ports, the city stood high with its magnificent and boastful white stone buildings and colorful roofs.

Many merchants, fishermen, travellers, and adventures comes and go through the city. Its ports always docked with thousands of ships, from small boats to luxurious noble ships.

To enter the city, one must cross the Galilec Gates. A giant gate a hundred meters tall built around the ocean surrounding the city. As travels comes and goes, they all eventually come to visit the same place.

The central docks of Galile, where bartering and trading of merchants happened.

On one of the docks in this expansive space, Josee's crew landed.

Wearing a simple straw bonnett hat, a simple orange skirt and a white long sleeve, Josee stepped into the pier. The noisy Central Docks were filled with hundreds after hundreds of people. Workers going about carrying crates after crates of goods, dock officers running about and inspecting, merchants tangled with other merchants busy haggling for new goods. It was a dock filled with many life.

She also saw the guards wearing a bluish-green scale armor made of a hard animal scale. Each of them also wore a scaled barbute helmet, a long steel tipped spear, and a jade-like sword in their hips.

'... Right. Those scales must be made from Marman scales, a type of large sea-horse animal with an aggressive behavior'

Bolli stepped besides Josee. Stretching his hands, he brightly smiled at her in a swuave manner.

"Mylady, I'm handsome aren't I?"

Deeply frowning with malice, Josee raised her left hand, but before she could slap him, Bolli was already behind Schulga.

"Schulga, your young lady is truly scary!", seeing Josee's terrifying expression sent shivers down his spine.

"Bolli", Schulga shook his head, "I told you she could kill you if she wants. Behave yourself"

"I'll heed you brother. I'll heed you!", Bolli deeply nodded, "Milady, please forgive me!"

Bowing down at the ground with his butt raised in the air, Josee only felt more and more annoyed. She started thinking it was a mistake to partner with him.

'... But we need the anonymity of his factonless background', Josee sighed, 'We can't get tangled with anyone for now'

"... Stand up Bolli", Josee coldly spoke, 

"... Where do we proceed from here?"

Upon hearing those business words, Bolli stood up straight. The playfulness in his face almost immediately disappearing.

"Yes. See that giant gate over there?"

Turning to the center of the island, Josee saw a collosal structure of sand ivory walls. In the middle was a giant slit acting like a gate.

"Thats the entrance to the city", Bolli smiled.

"From there. We will go to the Seven-Tree Company building and meet with their owner. Since you wish to establish a long term trading contract, the Seven-Tree owner will be your most suitable partner"

"... Good. Let's go"

Josee, Schulga, Bolli and her entourage of five guards began walking towards the entrance of the city. Along the way, many merchant stalls were set up. Many goods were being sold, from food, armor, weapon, every day items, and even luxury stuff and magical tools. The dense market were a bit hard to walk through.

Seeing the myriad of stalls with unique products, Josee's mind began crawling with ideas.

When Josee saw an enchanted dagger for sale, an idea popped in her mind.

'... Right. Enchantment. I need a comptent enchanter on top of a rune master', She turned to looked at her sleeve shirt.

'... My clothes are beginning to grow thin that the maids begun sewing me new ones', Josee lightly sighed.

'... I need new clothes, and a fire proof suit'

Entering the city gate, Josee saw the tall square buildings made of sand ivory stone. The traffic were huge, with many carts and carriages walking in and out of the gate.

'... There's not way they built this', Josee half-closed her eyes, '... This  architecture screams nothing but Precursor race'

After walking for two hundred meters and going through a street, Josee and her gang finally arrived at a large building. Unlike other buildings however, this one only had sand ivory stone in its ground walls. Its top floors were all made of wood plastered with white ash.

On its wide front door laid a sign of seven trees.

"The Seven-Tree Company", Bolli introduced them.

"Of course being a free city, the entire island is a den of hyenas", Bolli continued, "But the Seven-Tree company is not the richest, but the oldest company here. That's because of their stable and fair trade deals"

"... Good", Josee nodded before the group entered.


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


"Hmmm..."

The Seven-Tree owner was a slightly plump middle aged man with a long beard. His brown hair was well kept and shaven. His darker complezion showed the years of exposure under sunlight. Wearing an opulent orange noble clothe, he sat before Bolli who told him of the deal they want.
Besides Bolli was Josee, quietly seating at the side.

"You say you have 50 crates of fresh crops and that you can expand more and consistently supply every week?"

"Yes", Bolli smiled. The playfulness and mischief in his eyes were gone and all thats left was a serious businessman.
Signaling one of the guards, a small box was opened before Uriel. Inside were two layers of lettuce packed into a grid. At the stem of each lettuce was tied a small leaf pouch containing the nutrientional liquid which sustains the plant.
As Uriel inspects a piece of lettuce, he was surprised at the freshness of the plant and how vibrant it was.

"You didn't use magic for this box did you?"

"No", Bolli replied, "we did not"

"Then, what is this leaf pouch under the lettuce?"

"Thats contains a secret liquid we use to keep the plant fresh. You can think of it as liquid soil, it keeps the plant life longer during transit"

"Hmmmm"

Bolli's role in this business partnership between Josee and the buyer was simple. He was to act as a middle-man, bartering a good price for Josee's goods, overseeing the smooth process of selling the them and dealing with any regulation or beaurecracy.

Josee herself couldn't be bothered to deal with this personally. But to gain her trust, she decided to seat in the negotiation and watch Bolli's ability personally.

"We also have leeks, turnips, and wheat", Bolli smiled "in the future, we plan to expand our production to hundreds of crates of goods and depending on demand, plant new crops"

"Hmm... Certainly", Uriel frowned, "but i need to know. How much are you willing to sell a crate. A magic preserved crate of lettuce cost 2 gold each. "

"Well", Uriel lightly smiled, "certainly, when you import crops from the southern kingdom that's 4 days of travel by ship with ice magic on each box, that'll definitely be worth 2golds but"

Bolli lightly smiled, "we plan to sell our goods at half the market price"

The negotiations went well. And after much bartering, Bolli actually pulled off getting an exclusive contract from Uriel. In other words, from now on, Uriel will only buy crop goods from them.

Seeing the results personally Josee lightly nodded. Although Bolli had a disappointing personality, he was indeed the real deal.

After they left, Uriel stood before the window, watching the entourage leave.

Standing behind him was a beautiful woman with long dark hair. She bows lightly and asked.

"Master, whats on your mind?"

"... Hmmm", Uriel stared at the back of Josee. A slender and young girl, almost naive looking. And yet, Uriel couldn't help but feel a regal feeling from her.

"Josephine Kalingrad", Uriel suddenly uttered a name.

His secretary closed her eyes for a few moments before suddenly opening them.

"She is the daughter of Baron Kalingrad", the secretary explained, "They're an old and insignificant family from the Kingdom of Brytoria who owns a small port territory called Aquel. A village with barely 700 residents. In the past hundreds of years, they have not done anything of significance, merely keeping to themselves and sometimes serving a powerful lord. What about her?"

"Katrina. Your memory is as impressive as always", Uriel praised her, causing katrina to lightly smile.

"Thank you master"

"Bolli did not disclose where he got the crops but... after considering the give information. The single white haired knight can only belong to the kalingrad. That must be josee then""

"Then", katrina shook her eyes, "Does that mean the crops came from the barony?"

"Most likely", Uriel nodded.
Still, there was a strange feeling inside of him. A certain dread and fear he couldn't put in place.

Josee did not spoke the whole time. She merely sat at the sides and just watched with eyes downward.

But Uriel felt like there was something dangerous about her.

Something he shouldn't deal with.

But Uriel has lived a life of danger. And where danger lies, also lies great reward.

His instincts tells him there was more to this than meets the eyes.

"Investigate the history of the Kalingrad", Uriel ordered.

"And pay attention to Josephine Kalingrad"

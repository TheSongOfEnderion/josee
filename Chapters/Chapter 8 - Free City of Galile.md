**Chapter 8  - Shipment**

A few days passed, and Josee focused her entire attention in managing the rebuildment of Aquel.

To Josee who was a mechanical engineer in her life, it wasn't easy doing a civil engineer's work. Although she has a decent understanding of loads and moment of forces, it was still different when one applies it to buildings rather than machine parts.

But Josee felt frustrated at her limited understanding of construction, thus she came at a conclusion. To temporarily build houses to accomodate the villagers and later tear it down when she finds a more competent civil engineer.

Meeting with Friedrich earlier, he explained to Josee about fire runes.

"I apologize my lady. But runes simply aren't my specialty. I can create a basic fire rune but it's heat will not be sufficient to your needs"

Therefore, Josee opted to do it herself in the meantime.

With the full production of food from Friedrich, Josee's production of cement, and the occasional hunting of giant beasts for meat, Josee was able to address the basic needs of the village.

Because of the rocky shores of Aquel, it was easy to acquire stones needed for construction.

Thus on fourth day, the first concrete House in the village was built. Taking it as an experience, the village carpenters learned how to handle concrete and the building of twenty more houses began it's way.


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

The next day however, a guest arrived within Josee's office in the mansion.

Josee didn't think that Schulga's friend would arrive this quick.

A man with a scrawny hair, a jacket of dark rose color and a cheap dark brown leather pants. Underneath his jacket was a white long sleeve and a small bow tie.

"Good afternoon milady. I am Bolli of the West Wing Merchant Company"

Schulga stood besides him. Observing his friend he hasn't seen in years, somehow, Schulga sported an iffy look

"... Hmmm", Josee lightly tapped the office table. Wearing her usual and simple red dress, Josee observed Bolli.

"... My name is Josephine Kalingrad of the Kalingrad Barony. Anyway, let's skip the formalities. You sure came here fast"

Josee calculated that it should have taken atleast 3 days for him to come from the capital city to aquel by boat.

But for some reason, he arrived a day earlier, and with a ship strawn and filled with damages.

'... In other words, he used a wind stone to speedup his travel'

"Well. I heard a great opportunity from my good friend Schulga. He's an excellent knight and with a honest character, i truly believe him. Hahahaha-"

"... You're in debt aren't you?", Josee rolled her eyes from the fake flattery.

"Ahh. What makes you think that milady", cold sweat fell from his back.

"... Look", Josee replied with sharp, cold eyes "Neither you nor me are mentally brain damaged. The faster you get honest, the quicker we can make a deal"

"Hahaha. Schulga, your lady sure makes an impression"

Schulga on the other hand merely shook his head ans sighed.

"I apologize my lady. I knew this guy was a total whore, but he was a competent merchant. Now though", Schulga looked him with a pitying frown.

"H-Hey Schulga. I didn't mean for it to happen. That vile woman got me in debt!", frantically, he exclaimed in frustration.

As josee saw this, she shook her head.

"... This won't do. I can't make a deal with a guy like this"

"W-Wait my lady!", he raised his right arm as if trying to stop her.

"The letter wrote you need only to sell your crops to the Free city of Galile right?", Bolli wryly smiled, wiping the sweat off his forehead.

"I have connections there, I can easily sell the shipment and barter a good profit!"

"... hmmm", Josee lightly clasped her hands.

"Before that", suddenly Schulga interjected, "Bolli, who did you borrow money from?"

"Err, that", Bolli turned his gaze away.

Seeing this, Josee began recollecting her memories of the past. But for some reason, she couldn't quite recall what it was. Pulling her drawer, she took her journal and began flipping through it.

Schulga noticed this, and from the side of his eyes, caught a glimpse of the letters in the note.

'What are those? Ancient letters?'

Josee stopped her flipping.

"... Oh", Josee sighed, "Right"

Putting the notebook down, she clasped her hands once more.

"... I will not do any trade with you", Josee coldly stared at him.

"Ah, but why?", Bolli's body shivered.

"... You're wasting my fucking time", suddenly hearing the pretty noble lady cussed with such heavy tone, Bolli felt scared.

"A merchant in trouble is not a good partner. If you want to do business  with me, I need sufficient evidence that your future worth outweighs your present trouble"

As Bolli heard this, he heavily sighed. He looked at Josee with tired eyes as his shoulders dropped. Before coming here,he aimed to start a new life over, trading by sea to escape the land.

'Having received a letter from my friend, I thought this will be easy', Bolli thought.

It was the young lady of the Kalingrad territory. Although he didn't knew how they did it, but they have a large amount of crops. Knowing his friend, Schulga had no reason to lie. Thus Bolli chose to take this opportunity to escape.

And surely, there should be no difficulty striking a deal with a mere 17-years-old, right?

But that was not the case.

The person seating before him felt like a battle hardened politician with no opening.

"My problems, are under control", Bolli continued, "I got in debt with the Brytoria Mercantile Association"

"What?", Schulga deeply frowned, "I thought you borrowed money from loan sharks given you're running with your life"

"Well, thats the thing", Bolli replied as he made eye contact with Schulga.

"The Brytoria Mercantile Association changed leadership. They became more predatory than being simply regulation of the government. They target anyone that refuse to become a member of ther association. I was caught up due to gambling and women"

"Bolli", Schulga replied with furrowed eyebrows, "Haven't I always told you to stop thinking with your lower member?"

"Shit, how was I supposed to know she was the lion's den?!"

"... Hmmm", Josee lightly raised her eyebrows.

'_... Right, they felt threatened by the rising King of Gold, one of the male leads, from the western Empire, thus they started consolidating power and trade routes_'

'... Eventually, I will have to clsand with them', Josee tapped her fingers.

'_... If I remember correctly, the King of Gold will soon establish  the first true banks in this world. Currently associations fills that role in a pseudo manner like doing insurance and lending money, but only to merchants and sailors_'

"... Heh", Josee wickedly smiled.

As the two men watched Josee's terrible smile, a shiver ran down their spine.

"... Alright. Then let me ask you this", Josee stared right into Bolli's eyes. her Crimson iris felt burning to his body, forcing Bolli to gulp his mouth.

Bolli clenched his teeth.

"Do you know how to break inside the Brytoria Mercantile Association secretly?"

""What?"", the two men spoke at the same time.

"Milady!", Schulga stepped forwad, "That's too dangerous! The Brytoria Mercantile Association possess enough power to even sway the King! If you break inside, they will have hundreds of mages on their pockets!"

"... Who says i'm the one breaking inside?", Josee lightly giggled.

"... So, can you?", Josee turned her eyes to her parchment and began writing.

After thinking for a few momets, Bolli replied.

"I can", with a serious furrow in his face, "I know how to break inside"

"... Good", Josee replied.

"Now. let's discuss the details of our trade"


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


"... Can he be trusted?", Josee asked as she stands before the window, facing the village.

As Bolli left the office to go and see the goods, Josee stood up and observed the view to the village.

Bolstered by the new material, all the men in the village halted fishing and focused on helping rebuild the broken houses. Many were out gathering limestone and other ingredients. Meanwhile, the women were busy making huge community food for the hard working men.

"Bolli may seem a bit awkward milady", Schulga sighed, "But he's an honest man. He doesn't look rich because he spends his money only on two things. Women and helping the poor. That's why we are good friends""

"... And especially women", Josee scoffed.

"Yes. Unfortunately", Schulga scratched his forehead.

"But milady", he continued, "What is this about breaking inside the association"

"... I'll tell you later. Anyway", turning around, Josee stared at Schulga's eyes.

"... Call Nadia and have her ready my clothes. You too. We will accompany Bolli in the Free City of Galile"


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

The vast blue ocean of this world revealed itself before Josee. The salty wind flung her brown-range her backwards. Wearing a humble beige dress as if she's just a common woman, Josee stood at the bow of the ship with a sharp sword lay hanging on her hips.

"Err, we will need to take a segway because of Cetarax", Boli explained while wearing his jacket and leather pants, "I heard when Cetarax woke up he devoured a ship down"

"That's just nonsense", Schulga spoke. This time, he was wearing a leather armor fit with dark-blue color.

His shoulder-length white hair tied in a ponytail flew with the wind.

"If a ship fell, we would have known", he continued.

"Oh, so it was just rumours", with that in mind, Bolli scratched his small beard.

As the ship moved with the wind, Josee simply kept looking at the waters, lost in thought.

'I wanna kill cetarax so badly. I have to kill cetarax. I WILL fucking kill cetarax.'

Their one day journey to the free city of galile was extended to two days because of the detour they had to take.

Josee then remembered the fiery state she achieved last time, where she wielded flame like its metal.

'If i can maintain that form for at least 1 hour, i'll stand a chance at killing Cetarax', Josee remunerated, 'But i can't just kill. Its too wasteful. I need a powerful enemy to take down with him'

"But man", Bolli yawned, "you guys sure have a tremendous amount of crops. How did you buy preserve these at such freshness, its practically newly harvested!"
"That's a trade secret Bolli", Schulga replied.

"Oh man. We're best friends. Why not tell me? Just a hint?", a lascivious and greedy look appeared in Bolli's face forcing a vein to pop in Schulga's forehead.

Josee ignored their banter before walking back to the inner cabin.

Seating at a room that became her office, Josee laid down her parchments and begun drawing her plans.
'... The resources i need right now are mages and people. It's late spring right now and soon it will be summer. By winter I must expand my reach into the Cursed Forest and establish a wall to prevent the rampage of monsters'

Josee turned over to her right and picked up a drawing of a machine. Within that drawing was the exploded assembly of a steam engine with its simple construction, the piston, the cylinder, the belt, the boiler chamber, and more.
Looking closely, however, the drawings were drawn straight with confidence, but some parts were a bit awkward and uneven.

'... I need to acquire a lot of bronze from and steel from this journey so i can begin my manufacturing. Since Fredrich can make even a basic fire rune, all i need is some small mana stone and this bad boy will start running endlessly'

Josee then turned to other parchment, and in one of them saw a mechanical drawing of a rifle. Lightly smirking, Josee placed it down.

Picking up two pieces of strip metal from her drawer, Josee's hand grew so hot that the irons became red. Josee then applied pressure at the two and increased temperature at their contact point until the two welded.

Afterwards Josee took a bucket of water and quenched the metal inside, causing a small but sudden steam.

After a few seconds, Josee picked the wet metal observing it, she lightly frowned.

There were many cracks on the welded metal, specially at their contact point.

"... Hmm. I thought i got the temperature right. But it was too hot"

Shrugging her shoulders, Josee melted the metals and formed too small spheres with it. As the journey to their destination continued, Josee kept practicing with her temperature control.

◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

As the fresh light of morning dew entered the mansion, Fredrich woke up to a new day.

He sleeps in a humble soft bed in one of the rooms within the Kalingrad mansion. Though small it may be, it was warm and comfortable to him.

After using water magic to bath and heat magic to dry himself, Fredrich wore his long green linen shirt and brown long pants. From a closet in the corner, he pulled  a dark coat given to him by the lady of the mansion.

Fredrich starts his day by going to the large warehouse containing the crops that he was growing. After the initial success, the warehouse was expanded and more beds of crops were made.

Around ten villagers helped in full-time with mixing the nutritional liquid, pouring them into the beds, placing the sapplings, and harvesting them. A different group of villagers were then responsible for collecting raw material. All Fredrich had to do was cast growth spell over and over again that he had practically gotten bored with it, activating the spell without much thought.

Whenever Friedrich looked at the bountiful harvest that appears every 3 minutes, he couldn't help but shook his head.

"A completely unorthodox method. Who would have thought of using a mage, and a wizard at that, for such menial task?"

To Friedrich, and to every other mage, Magic was used for two things; explorig the mysteries of the cosmos or as weapons of war.

Not only was magic difficult to learn, it was even more difficult to master. Hence many kingdoms used magic as a symbol of nobility and power. But after living in Aquel for a few days, Friedrich came to understand the nature of Josephine Kalingrad.

Nothing is beyond her violation. Anything and Everything that can and will be of use to the fullfillment of a purpose will and shall be used.

To use such powerful and grand beings as mere tools of production was a way of thinking that shattered Fredrich's traditional mindset. Initially, he could not fathom such disrespect. But after learning of the bounty of josee's innovation did he realize he was wrong the whole time.

But it didn't stop there, Josee even asked to use runes to burn mere stones. Friedrich couldn't take it, but after considering her proposition and the result of the concrete houses did he finally realized.

Josee was no mere cruel noble. She was an Inventor, and a genius one at that.

'Perhaps that's the reason why the First Flame chose her?', Friedrich thought as he cast another growth spell to a batch of wheats.

"Oh. Is sir mage here?", an old and creeky voice came from the entrance of the warehouse.

Friedrich turned towards the wide door and saw an old village lady wearing a yellow-brown village dress.

"Hoo, sir mage", the old lady walked forward and handed Fredrich a basket filled with sandwich with meat inside them and lettuce leafs.

"Ah, No", Friedrich was caught off guard, causing him to cancel the casting of growth spell.

"I-I don't need", Friedrich opened and closed his mouth, his eyes flustered at the sudden gift.

"Haha, no need to be shy", the old wrinkled lady smiled brightly. 

"It's just my way of thanking you for making us so many crops. My dear Ellen was able to eat fresh vegetables because of you. We no longer have to worry about hunger"

"Oh", Upon hearing her words, Fredrich's dark and terrible eyes momentarily shined a humble glint.

"Then. Thank you", Fredrich nodded.

"Haha, no, thank you sir mage. I'll be going then", the old lady turned around and slowly began walking back to the village.

Around him, the ten workers, men of all ages looked at the quiet back of Friedrich. They smiled warmly at the unsocial mage before continuing their work.

Friedrich has always kept to himself. When people tried to talk to him, he simply nodded and continued moving. To Friedrich, all that mattered was that he regained his 6th Circle Wizard status as soon as he can and to figure more about the Great Cold whose pursuit killed his master.

He placed his hand inside the basket, slowly picking a sandwich and taking a bite.

It wasn't the most delicious sandwich in the world, nor was it made with the highest of quality of ingredients, food which Friedrich grew accustomed with.

And yet, this humble sandwich made him feel warmth in his cold frozen heart.

Friedrich gulped down before staring back at the sandwich.

"It taste good"

◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

The Light of Dawn emerged in the Free City of Galile.

A major hub filled with hundreds of ports, the city stood high with its magnificent and boastful white stone buildings and colorful roofs.

Many merchants, fishermen, travellers, and adventures comes and go through the city. Its ports always docked with thousands of ships, from small boats to luxurious noble ships.

To enter the city, one must cross the Galilec Gates. A giant gate a hundred meters tall built around the ocean surrounding the city. As travels comes and goes, they all eventually come to visit the same place.

The central docks of Galile, where bartering and trading of merchants happened.

On one of the docks in this expansive space, Josee's crew landed.

Wearing a simple straw bonnett hat, a simple orange skirt and a white long sleeve, Josee stepped into the pier. The noisy Central Docks were filled with hundreds after hundreds of people. Workers going about carrying crates after crates of goods, dock officers running about and inspecting, merchants tangled with other merchants busy haggling for new goods. It was a dock filled with many life.

Bolli stepped besides Josee. Stretching his hands, he brightly smiled at her in a swuave manner.

"Mylady, I'm handsome aren't I?"

Deeply frowning with malice, Josee raised her left hand, but before she could slap him, Bolli was already behind Schulga.

"Schulga, your young lady is truly scary!", seeing Josee's terrifying expression sent shivers down his spine.

"Bolli", Schulga shook his head, "I told you she could kill you if she wants. Behave yourself"

"I'll heed you brother. I'll heed you!", Bolli deeply nodded, "Milady, please forgive me!"

Bowing down at the ground with his butt raised in the air, Josee only felt more and more annoyed. She started thinking it was a mistake to partner with him.

'... But we need the anonymity of his factonless background', Josee sighed, 'We can't get tangled with anyone for now'

"... Stand up Bolli", Josee coldly spoke, 

"... Where do we proceed from here?"

Upon hearing those business words, Bolli stood up straight. The playfulness in his face almost immediately disappearing.

"Yes. See that giant gate over there?"

Turning to the center of the island, Josee saw a collosal structure of sand ivory walls. In the middle was a giant slit acting like a gate.

"Thats the entrance to the city", Bolli smiled.

"From there. We will go to the Seven-Tree Company building and meet with their owner. Since you wish to establish a long term trading contract, the Seven-Tree owner will be your most suitable partner"

"... Good. Let's go"

Josee, Schulga, Bolli and her entourage of five guards began walking towards the entrance of the city. Along the way, many merchant stalls were set up. Many goods were being sold, from food, armor, weapon, every day items, and even luxury stuff and magical tools. The dense market were a bit hard to walk through.

Seeing the myriad of stalls with unique products, Josee's mind began crawling with ideas.

When Josee saw an enchanted dagger for sale, an idea popped in her mind.

'... Right. Enchantment. I need a comptent enchanter on top of a rune master', She turned to looked at her sleeve shirt.

'... My clothes are beginning to grow thin that the maids begun sewing me new ones', Josee lightly sighed.

'... I need new clothes, and a fire proof suit'

Entering the city gate, Josee saw the tall square buildings made of sand ivory stone. The traffic were huge, with many carts and carriages walking in and out of the gate.

'... There's not way they built this', Josee half-closed her eyes, '... This  architecture screams nothing but Precursor race'

After walking for two hundred meters and going through a street, Josee and her gang finally arrived at a large building. Unlike other buildings however, this one only had sand ivory stone in its ground walls. Its top floors were all made of wood plastered with white ash.

On its wide front door laid a sign of seven trees.

"The Seven-Tree Company", Bolli introduced them.

"Of course being a free city, the entire island is a den of hyenas", Bolli continued, "But the Seven-Tree company is not the richest, but the oldest company here. That's because of their stable and fair trade deals"

"... Good", Josee nodded before the group entered.


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


"Hmmm..."

The Seven-Tree owner was a slightly plump middle aged man with a long beard. His brown hair was well kept and shaven. His darker complezion showed the years of exposure under sunlight. Wearing an opulent orange noble clothe, he sat before Bolli who told him of the deal they want.
Besides Bolli was Josee, quietly seating at the side.

"You say you have 50 crates of fresh crops and that you can expand more and consistently supply every week?"

"Yes", Bolli smiled. The playfulness and mischief in his eyes were gone and all thats left was a serious businessman.
Signaling one of the guards, a small box was opened before Uriel. Inside were two layers of lettuce packed into a grid. At the stem of each lettuce was tied a small leaf pouch containing the nutrientional liquid which sustains the plant.
As Uriel inspects a piece of lettuce, he was surprised at the freshness of the plant and how vibrant it was.

"You didn't use magic for this box did you?"

"No", Bolli replied, "we did not"

"Then, what is this leaf pouch under the lettuce?"

"Thats contains a secret liquid we use to keep the plant fresh. You can think of it as liquid soil, it keeps the plant life longer during transit"

"Hmmmm"

Bolli's role in this business partnership between Josee and the buyer was simple. He was to act as a middle-man, bartering a good price for Josee's goods, overseeing the smooth process of selling the them and dealing with any regulation or beaurecracy.

Josee herself couldn't be bothered to deal with this personally. But to gain her trust, she decided to seat in the negotiation and watch Bolli's ability personally.

"We also have leeks, turnips, and wheat", Bolli smiled "in the future, we plan to expand our production to hundreds of crates of goods and depending on demand, plant new crops"

"Hmm... Certainly", Uriel frowned, "but i need to know. How much are you willing to sell a crate. A magic preserved crate of lettuce cost 2 gold each. "

"Well", Uriel lightly smiled, "certainly, when you import crops from the southern kingdom that's 4 days of travel by ship with ice magic on each box, that'll definitely be worth 2golds but"

Bolli lightly smiled, "we plan to sell our goods at half the market price"

The negotiations went well. And after much bartering, Bolli actually pulled off getting an exclusive contract from Uriel. In other words, from now on, Uriel will only buy crop goods from them.

Seeing the results personally Josee lightly nodded. Although Bolli had a disappointing personality, he was indeed the real deal.

After they left, Uriel stood before the window, watching the entourage leave.

Standing behind him was a beautiful woman with long dark hair. She bows lightly and asked.

"Master, whats on your mind?"

"... Hmmm", Uriel stared at the back of Josee. A slender and young girl, almost naive looking. And yet, Uriel couldn't help but feel a regal feeling from her.

"Josephine Kalingrad", Uriel suddenly uttered a name.

His secretary closed her eyes for a few moments before suddenly opening them.

"She is the daughter of Baron Kalingrad", the secretary explained, "They're an old and insignificant family from the Kingdom of Brytoria who owns a small port territory called Aquel. A village with barely 700 residents. In the past hundreds of years, they have not done anything of significance, merely keeping to themselves and sometimes serving a powerful lord. What about her?"

"Katrina. Your memory is as impressive as always", Uriel praised her, causing katrina to lightly smile.

"Thank you master"

"Bolli did not disclose where he got the crops but... after considering the give information. The single white haired knight can only belong to the kalingrad. That must be josee then""

"Then", katrina shook her eyes, "Does that mean the crops came from the barony?"

"Most likely", Uriel nodded.
Still, there was a strange feeling inside of him. A certain dread and fear he couldn't put in place.

Josee did not spoke the whole time. She merely sat at the sides and just watched with eyes downward.

But Uriel felt like there was something dangerous about her.

Something he shouldn't deal with.

But Uriel has lived a life of danger. And where danger lies, also lies great reward.

His instincts tells him there was more to this than meets the eyes.

"Investigate the history of the Kalingrad", Uriel ordered.

"And pay attention to Josephine Kalingrad"

◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


With 25 gold in Josee's hand, she obtained good profit in this transaction. With the transaction complete, Bolli left with two other guards to begin transferring the crate goods to the Seven-Tree warehouse.

As for Josee, she began heading to the magic district within Galile.

'Once i obtained enough warding stone and explore the inner parts of the cursed forest, there should be a mine of sort inside.'

Looking at the glass panels of many magic shops, Josee saw a variety of equipments and tools.

Of course most of them were low level or barely functional, as true magic tools were not only expensive but hard to come by.

'Since i'll be conducting a lot of sea business, I should build a steam engine for a boat as soon as i can. Once that's done, no ship in this world will be able to keep up'

Of course Josee knew of the existence of wind stones which can propel a large gust of wind to move a ship at a fast rate, or ships with dedicated wind mages to push it.

But all of those were hard to control and doesn't have the same maneuverability as a steam boat.

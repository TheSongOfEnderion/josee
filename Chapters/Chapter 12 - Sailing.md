# Chapter 12

After dealing with the Pedonas' Family and getting her payment, Josee lightly strolled around in the Free City Shopping District.

For one main purpose.

To buy dresses.

Within one of the moderate dress shop, Josee was sizing some dress in a hanger while standing before a mirror. Schulga stood behind her. Wearing hisleather armor and looking a bit uncomfortable, schulga had a wry look on his face.

[I want a large Ship]

He remembered his noble lady's words.

'So that's why she asked for twice the ship men to come and why she said she won't pay for the ship', Schulga couldn't help but wryly smile.

But he nodded his head. He quite remembered the originaly personality of his noble lady. Thinking about that, Schulga through there wasn't much difference after all.

'Even back then, Lady Josee would simply ask what she wants and what she thinks with a straight forward face wthout any thoughts of deceit', thinking like this, Schulga could not help but shook his head.

'How did it take this long for me to realize? It was so simple from the start', as he continued that line of thought, he really couldn't help but laugh at himself.

The tone and voice changed, but the attitude remained all the same. And that knowledge comforted Schulga.

'It's still her'

"... Damn, that's a nice dress", Josee glanced at her right and saw a red dress with simple and yet elegant design.

"... Give me that, also that one, oh, and those pants"

"B-But, those are for men"

"... Woman, did I stutter?"

"N-no!", the attendant nervously replied.

To Josee who burns through cloths like they're paper towel, its not an exagerration to say she desperately need new ones. It came to a point where she stitched her own made out of monster hides.

After all if she burns through her few remaining clothing, what will she wear? The servant's dress? To Josee who maintains a certain level of dignity, that was unacceptable.

'... I really need to create my own textile industry. Or get myself an armor artefact'

After shopping for an hour and buying up entire gallery of clothing from shops after shops, Josee ended up hiring three cart and a coachmen to transfer all the boxes of dresses she bought.

"Milady", Schulga spoke, staring at the three large carts filled to the brim.

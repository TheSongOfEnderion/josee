# Chapter 12 - Sailing

After dealing with the Pedonas' Family and getting her payment, Josee lightly strolled around in the Free City Shopping District.

For one main purpose.

To buy dresses.

Within one of the moderate dress shop, Josee was sizing some dress in a hanger while standing before a mirror. Schulga stood behind her. Wearing his leather armor and looking a bit uncomfortable, schulga had a wry look on his face.

[I want a large Ship]

He remembered his noble lady's words.

'So that's why she asked for twice the ship men to come and why she said she won't pay for the ship', Schulga couldn't help but wryly smile.

But he nodded his head. He quite remembered the original personality of his noble lady. Thinking about that, Schulga thought there wasn't much difference after all.

'Even back then, Lady Josee would simply ask what she wants and what she thinks with a straight forward face wthout any thoughts of deceit', thinking like this, Schulga could not help but shook his head.

'How did it take this long for me to realize? It was so simple from the start', as he continued that line of thought, he really couldn't help but laugh at himself.

The tone and voice changed, but the attitude remained all the same. And that knowledge comforted Schulga.

'It's still her'

"... Damn, that's a nice dress", Josee glanced at her right and saw a red dress with simple and yet elegant design.

"... Give me that, also that one, oh, and those pants"

"B-But, those are for men"

"... Woman, did I stutter?"

"N-no!", the attendant nervously replied.

To Josee who burns through cloths like they're paper towel, its not an exagerration to say she desperately need new ones. It came to a point where she stitched her own made out of monster hides.

After all if she burns through her few remaining clothing, what will she wear? The servant's dress? To Josee who maintains a certain level of dignity, that was unacceptable.

'... I really need to create my own textile industry. Or get myself an armor artefact'

After shopping for an hour and buying up entire gallery of clothing from shops after shops, Josee ended up hiring three cart and a coachmen to transfer all the boxes of dresses she bought. The cart also contained Josee's writing stuff such as parchment, scrolls, ink and quills.

"Milady", Schulga spoke, staring at the three large carts filled to the brim.

"You've brought dresses. What about armor?"

"... That's meaningless", Josee replied, "It'll just get torn in one run"

"I, I see"

Josee didn't think that the Pedonas Family's Lord would be quite generous.

After asking for a large ship, he felt it was not enough and offered her more. Therefore, Josee asked for money and he casually gave her 5000 gold.

It was such a large amount equivalent to a few milion dollars. He also mentioned he will send her more after dealing with the paper works.

Josee knew she would be given a good reward, but she didn't think it'd be this many. Thus, she decided to move forward with her plans.

A small candle dimly lit the dark quarters within the ship. Writing on a parchment, Josee continued with her thoughts. She wore a loosely hanging white gown that lets air enters through its comfortable fabric. Her brown hair was let down, flowly smoothly throug her shoulders.

'... The precursor's annihilation did not occur in one day', Josee thought to herself.

'... It was a protracted and arduous process that lasted several generations. Beginning with the Great Cold that destroyed the atmosphere'

Josee focused her eyes on the plans drawn in her parchment.

'... The timeframe from the novel is thirty years from now. We can't be certain. My interference migh drastically change things knowing they didn't come here from the sky, but through predetermined portals'

Josee gritted her teeth.

'... That meant if they can open those portals, it can be opened early'

That's the reason why Josee was adamant against hunting the seeds of darkness. They share the same nature as the chaos titans or worse, might be chaos titans themselves.

If Josee calously hunted them down, she might alert all of them. By then, without reaching her full potential, the world would end. Not even her fire can save her.

'... There's simply too few information. And I can't just pull it from the Cinder Flames, it requires... stimulation to share me knowledge'

Therefore,  Josee came to a conclusion.

'... I'm not certain if I can stop the Great Cold itself. Therefore, mankind must technology advance enough to survive without the surface environment'

For that purpose, Josee began drafting the government system she will develop for her territory. After all, a rift-raft of directly ordering peasants and rewarding them with food simply will not do. It was unscalable.

But as Josee kept writing her government, a vein popped in her forehead.

Standing up and walking to the door, she kicked it open. What filled her eyes was a brightly lit inner area of the ship where the men were feasting, drinking, and eating. They were dancing and laughing and being rowdy.  Around them, some of the villagers were also singing and playing a string guitar and some acoustic drums.

But what annoyed Josee was that the men decided it was a good idea to have a fist fight, thus even Schulga who was a bit tipsy was at the center was busy fist fighting Bolli. Their fighting was starting to irritate her as the men begun trash talking really loudly.

"Schulga, you've grown rusty man! You really ought to settle down, old man", Bolli jeered.

"Bahh! Who would want to woo your fat mom!", Schulga laughingly scolded back.

"Bets on sir schulga!"

"I'm placing 10 coppers on Bolli"

As the door to Josee's office swung opened violently, it suddenly stopped the music and the merry atmosphere became frozen.

"... Oh wow. Good. Good", Josee's brown hair almost stood up, "You guy's sure like to have fun don't you?"

Suddenly, the men all fixed the thrown around bottles, chairs, and tables and all swiftly sat upright. With a flushed faced, Schulga gulped down and bowed. Bolli on the other hand, sat with his back towards Josee, drinking his ale like nothing happened.

"I apologize my lady! It was my fault!", shouted schulga in embarassment.

"... Tsk", Josee scoffed.

"... Keep it down!", before slamming the door again and hiding.

Silence filled the room. But a few more moments passed, and the music came back, albet in a more lighter manner. The men sighed in relief, as the opressive aura that Josee showed was something that scared all these adult men.

"The lady really became different", the men whisphered in hush voices.

"Hah. I miss the sweet and innocent young lady"

"When she woke up from the coma, its like she became a different person"

"But still, something about her remained the same", when one of the men mentioned this, they kept their ears in attention. Schulga also sat there, quietly drinking his ale.

The villager continued, "She still care a lot about us. Wasn't she the reason why our families are no longer starving and we have a strong roof above our heads? Now, we even got this trade which will definitely make our village prosper"

"Indeed", Schulga finally opened his mouth. Their eyes were perked at him. Meanwhile, Bolli sat from a distance, quietly observing.

"Her personality may have changed. But she's still the same lady", Schulga remembered Josee's mannerism. Her biting of her nail when she's thinking, the veins popping in her forehead when she's irritated, and how she couldn't stand others suffering.

She became crueler, more decisive, smarter, and powerful.

But there was no hiding the things formed by habit, it could not be faked. He would be lying if he said he completely believed what his lady said to him on the carriage that day. Schulga was no fool, he had seen scheming eyes which hides the truth behind a veil, he was all too familiar.

And the things he's oberseved, the things he noted, all concluded one thing.

Schulga smiled.

"It's her"


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


Misha had spent her whole life within the village of Aquel. Born from one of the villagers, Misha grew up humbly, eating fish her father caught and vegetables her mother grew in their backyard. Life was not too bad, and the Lord did not really tax them too much, rather, preferring to use his meager wealth to help make the village survive. As a result, when the baron needed servants, Misha volunteered to work.

The job wasn't that difficult. No different from what she did in the house, Misha cleaned, cooked, and took care of minor stuff. The other servants were her aunts or neighbors, as such, she didn't feel out of place.

Misha liked working here. When she meets the kind baron, he would give her candies from the capital which she really loved. She didn't care much for the coins that the Lord gave her and thus she just handed them to her mother who was busy with their livestocks and drying fish.

And just like that, the days passed idly. But their village was not prosperous, and when the storm hit, it made everything terrible.

Misha could clearly remember the pained expression of her mother who saw their roof fly away from the terrible storm. Most of the livestocks also vanished, and the fish that her father caught barely made do for their meal.

But their humble lord could not stand their pain, and Misha saw him leave to the capital. It seems he'll look for money or help. She didn't really understand, but she prayed to the divines they would protect him.

But as the Baron left, his daughter's attendant, Olenko, also came with him. Thus the young lady needed an attendant to serve her.

Misha was chosen for this.

The young lady was cheerful, bright, and beautiful. She always heard from her elders that lady Josephine was the spitting image of her late mother.

Misha liked her personality because she always treated her like a little sister. Although she was a bit shorter than her, the young lady would always try to hug her and spin her around while laughing.

"M-Milady! I-I'll fly away!"

"Hahaha! Misha, we're going to fly!"

"P-Please stop! huhu"

Despite the terrible circumstances the territory was in, Josephine's cheerfulness instilled a sense of hope among the villagers. She would help hammering the walls, or planting vegetables, or on occasion would go fishing with the villagers.

To Misha, Josephine's cheerful personality was a ray of light she always admired. A hope that everything will be okay.

That is, until one day when Josephine was riding a horse and she suddenly fell down.

Misha still remembered. They were walking on a leisurely afternoon on the coast and Misha was guiding the horse when suddenly, Josephine froze and she fell down.

She became comatosed.

Misha blamed herself for not being able to protect the young lady. But the elders comforted her saying she didn't do anything wrong.

"It was my fault. Uwahh!"

But Misha would not stop blaming herself and diligently took care of the lady while she slumbers. 

The kind Father Pedran tried casting a prayer and some healing magic on her but it did nothing.

And so the yoing lady Josephine slumbered in her sleep.

But Misha noticed something. From time to time, Josephine's hair would blink from brown to blood crimson. Misha scrubbed her eyes, but she opened it again, Lady Josephine was back to normal.

She must be hallucinating from the tears and sadness she felt.

That was, until one day, her precioUs lady woke up.

And she was no longer herself.


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


After bringing half the men with her to sail the larger vessel, Josephine ordered Bolli to sail the smaller ship back to Aquel, together with the goods she bought as well as the butt load of daily necessities and materials that the villagers would need.

Now left with a large vessel and a fuck-ton of money, Josee ordered the large ship to sail south.

In the ship's steering wheel, a man with a curly beard and short stature stood. He was wearing blue shorts and a vest made of leather. 

Josee stood besides him as he begun steering the ship. She was wearing a humble brown dress that fit her slender body quite nicely. Her hair was tied in a bun, with a small wooden stick holding it. Besides her, Schulga stood with a white long sleeve, a leather vest, and leather pants. His silver hair  tied in a ponytail.

"... Mormo", Josee spoke his name. He was one of the veteran villagers who knew how to steer a ship.

"... Keep going south until you see the Three Peak islands", Josee commanded as they left the sea gates of the Free city into the vast sea.

""W-What?!"", both Schulga and Mormo stared at her with great alarm.

"Milady, we can't go there!", Schulga grit his teeth, "That's pirate area!"

"Sir Schulga is right!", Mormo hastily added, "They will attack us the moment we arrive!"

"... Huh?", Josee rolled her eyes.

"... Of couse it's the pirate area...", and  suddenly she wickedly smiled, "Where else can we find a lot of pirates except in their base?"

The two flinched at the crazed smile that Josee showed. Watching her giggle, the two felt a creep run through their back.

Schulga felt something dangerous was about to happen. He came to learn now but Josee would make that smile only when she's up to no good.

But alas, there was no point in arguing with her. And so, bracing his heart, the ship headed straight into the ocean's dangerous waters.


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


The peaceful wind of the night embraces Josee's ship, and as the crew held their breathing in tense, they quitely hide behind a small island. Their lanterns were off, with only the moonlight dimly lighting the deck.

Schulga walked towards Josee who stared at the distant island with three protruding peaks.

She wickedly smiled, licking her lips as the thought of acquiring even more wealth made Josee shiver.

"Milady... ", Schulga wryly looked at the woman who had worn leather pants and dark red long sleeve. Her hair tied like a ponytail and a rapier quietly hangs by her waist. A hooded dark cloack covered here back.

"Are you sure about this? All i can think is that this is a terrible idea!", Schulga shook his head in worry.

"... What do you mean terrible?", Josee laughed, "This is the bestest idea i've ever had!"

Galiantly walking to the boat hanging by the deck. The villagers held their breathing in tension. They knew Josee had grown powerful, but to fight an entire pirate enclave?

It was madness! They all thought. But who would have the guts to defy the lady's order?

Josee hopped inside and signalled the crew men to lower her to the sea. 

"Milady", Schulga deeply frowned. A great worry in his mind.

"... Oh please, what are you my mother?", Josee rolled her eyes.

"... I'll be fine. They quite literally cannot kill me"

"But still!", Schulga grit his teeth, "At least let me come with you!"

"... And what?", Josee scolded, "Leave the crew undefended? No. Your role will be to stay here and light a flare if something happens"

"I Understand", Schulga looked down and deeply sighed.

"... Stop being like a lost puppy. If I have not returned by dawn, you have permission to enter the island. Understand?"

Hearing this, Schulga raised his head, staring straight at Josee.

"Understood. Be careful milady!"

Josee nodded and beckoned the men, lowering her boat to the sea. As she rowed it towards the three peak islands, the crew stared at her fading shadow in the blackness of the night.

"Will she be fine?", Mormo asked while drinking a cup of ale.

"She'll be okay", Schulga sighed.

'I need to train', he stared at his rough hands filled with Calluses. And as he remembered what happened a day earlier, he could not help but feel bitter.

'At this rate, I'm nothing more than a glorified guard. I need to be better'

◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

In the dimness of the night, beneath a shining moon, an island glew proudly admist the roaring sea.

The squandor and noise it showed appeared almost beautiful in its loneliness. Many shanty huts littered the land. Torches set the places lit as many men danced in its center, intoxicated in its drunkness and fervor. A great feast was on its way as foods litered the many tables.

Women in scant clothing were busy serving food and beer, many of whom were also busy serving the drunk men.

Dancing and singing, some brown skinned boys where drumming and playing trumpets, wearing but thin and dirty linen shirts and pants.

At the side the great plaza where the men were drinking, cages after cages filled with shivering and cold slaves where hurdeled and shaking. Their eyes shows fear, anger, sadness, hate, hunger... An uncertainty and emptiness filled their cold hearts.

"This, is to our King!", a man with large dark beard and skinny bone shouted, holding a golden cup in his hand. 

""To our King!"", the men shouted. Their bodies were coated with golden jewelries and diamond decorations, all looted from some poor merchant.

The men who were merrily dancing eyed his cup, looking at it with great envy. But who would dare steal his cup? Not one soul did.

"Once we were in squander, barely scrapping by!", the skinny man smiled with his terrible terrible teeth baring against the hundreds of onlookers.

"But now, we shall feast like royals! To the King!"

""To the King!!"", all of the men shouted in greed.

As the night continued, the island delved into even greater debauchery. Sex, violation, theft, intoxciation, even murder. Admist all of this, a shadow slowly crept forward. As the drumbs and strings of music roared the plaza, the single lone figure stood out like a sore thumb.

Drinking and kissing two women, the skinny man sat at the center chair, 

"Wait! Stop!!"

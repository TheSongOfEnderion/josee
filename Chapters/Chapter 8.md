Josee didn't think that Schulga's friend would arrive this quick.

A man with a scrawny hair, a jacket of dark rose color and a cheap dark brown leather pants. Underneath his jacket was a white long sleeve and a small bow tie.

"Good afternoon milady. I am Bolli of the West Wing Merchant Company"

Schulga stood besides him. Observing his friend he hasn't seen in years, somehow, Schulga sported an iffy look

"... Hmmm", Josee lightly tapped the office table. Wearing her usual and simple red dress, Josee observed Bolli.

"... My name is Josephine Kalingrad of the Kalingrad Barony. Anyway, let's skip the formalities. You sure came here fast"

Josee calculated that it should have taken atleast 3 days for him to come from the capital city to aquel by boat.

But for some reason, he arrived a day earlier, and with a ship strawn and filled with damages.

'... In other words, he used a wind stone to speedup his travel'

"Well. I heard a great opportunity from my good friend Schulga. He's an excellent knight and with a honest character, i truly believe him. Hahahaha-"

"... You're in debt aren't you?", Josee rolled her eyes from the fake flattery.

"Ahh. What makes you think that milady", cold sweat fell from his back.

"... Look", Josee replied with sharp, cold eyes "Neither you nor me are mentally brain damaged. The faster you get honest, the quicker we can make a deal"

"Hahaha. Schulga, your lady sure makes an impression"

Schulga on the other hand merely shook his head ans sighed.

"I apologize my lady. I knew this guy was a total whore, but he was a competent merchant. Now though", Schulga looked him with a pitying frown.

"H-Hey Schulga. I didn't mean for it to happen. That vile woman got me in debt!", frantically, he exclaimed in frustration.

As josee saw this, she shook her head.

"... This won't do. I can't make a deal with a guy like this"

"W-Wait my lady!"

**Chapter 6  - Food Problem**

The next day afternoon, Josee brought Fredriech to the warehouse left of the Kalingrad Mansion where she left her experiment unfinished.

After Josee had learned the existence of Growth Spurt, she had to alter her idea for the hydroponics farm. Initially, she wanted to farm vertically in order to maximize the space due to limited land before scaling it to full production.

Of course a vertical farm, though simple, had its own engineering problems such as pumping the water up and recirculating it back to the system. But the existence of a mage entirely made this method unnecessary for her intended purpose.

After instructing the change to the carpenters, what was later left was a rectangular clay container about 15cm high,  4m long and 1m wide. There were five of these clay containers laid on the ground. On the top of the clay containers were long strips of wood made into grid patterns where the plants will be hanged.

Josee woke up early in the morning to personally bake the clay, hardening it.

"My lady", Fredriech spoke, "What are these things for?"

"... It's your new job", Josee softly replied. 

"... Pour the solution", She turned around commanded her servants. Two men then poured a barrel full of brownish nutrient solution into one of the clay container.

'... Ash for potassium, seashells for calcium, bone meal for prosperous, and compost for micronutrients'

As the water were poured inside, Fredriech couldn't help but close his nose from the mild stench it emitted.

"... The solution is a ratio of 3 parts compost, 2 parts bone meal, 1 part ash, and 1 part calcium", Josee explained.

Hearing her, Fredriech immediately focused his attention. As Josee continued speaking, he felt like he was talking with an Alchemist rather than a cold-blooded woman.

"... I've tested a few different ratios including different speed on casting growth spurt earlier. For now, I've only tested this for Lettuce"

Josee turned around. Seeing the dozens of piled lettuce on the table, Fredriech realized how hardworking Josee was. Some lettuce were dried, some were short, some were long, some were rotten.

"I still don't understand, what is the solution for?", Fredriech asked.

"... Let me demonstrate", Josee then took a lettuce sapling from a tray on the table that she had prepared earlier this morning and placed it on a grid. The plant's roots then touches the liquid below.

"Hmm... This is farming, right?", Fredriech frowned, "How would the plants grow if there's no soil? Lettuces aren't aquatic plants"

But Josee did not reply and merely cast growth spurt on the plant. As the red magic circle shined at the lettuce sampling, slowly it began growing in size until after five minutes of waiting, it grew fully. The two servants behind Josee clapped in awe.

Seeing this, Fredriech eyes' widened.

"W-ha-?, How in the world did that work?!"

Josee then stood up and explained.

"... I'm still not certain if it's the nutrient solution, the magic, or the gene-, I mean, the plant itself. But five minutes is the optimal time for lettuce growth. Anything more or less will result in an unhealthy plant"

"Wait", Fredriech was quick on the uptake. After piecing the puzzle together, he finally came to a conclusion.

"So", he continued, "If I'm correct, that solution is concentrated plant sustenance?"

"... I'm glad you're not an idiot", Josee heaved a sigh of relief.

Seeing her act like that, a slight vein popped in Fredriech's forehead. His mouth twitched as he sported a fake smile.

"But, how can it grow without the earth?", Fredriech wondered. He was a mage, a student of the mystical arts. But even then, he had never heard such an unorthodox method of growing plants.

"... The earth is just a medium for these", Josee pointed at the solution.

"But, why?", Fredriech rapidly blinked his eyes.

"Can't we just plant them in the soil directly?"

"... For a former 6th Circle Wizard, you sure lack basic knowledge", Josee sighed.

As he heard another insult, Fredriech simply smiled as a crack formed in his smile.

"... When Growth Spurt is used on the soil, it drains the nutrients and puts it to the plant. Magic isn't so magical. An equal conversion has to be paid for every transaction. So if you keep using growth spurt on the planted crop, it'll leave your earth completely cracked and useless"

"Ah!", Fredriech cried.

Upon hearing her explanation, Fredriech felt as though something just opened in his mind. A certain revelation. Everything suddenly made sense now.

"... It's good you understand"

Josee then stood up and readied herself to leave.

"... For now, I cannot spare any gold to pay you. But I will write a legal contract stating the terms of your employment. Fear not, it will be fair. For now, I need you to keep planting and harvesting lettuces. My servants will explain the rest"

Josee explained before walking outside the warehouse, leaving Fredriech there frozen on the spot with wide eyes opened.

"... Ah, one more thing", Josee then remarked.

"... Keep doing it until you're completely exhausted"

Afterwards, she left the warehouse. The two servants stood at the side, waiting for Fredriech to react. The two glanced at each other, not knowing what to do.

Right now something has taken a hold of Fredriech's mind. A certain phrase resonated in his mind.

'An equal conversion has to be paid for every transaction'

It was like a dam was just opened in his mind. He still couldn't wrap his head completely, but his instincts as a formerly powerful wizard told him something.

That this statement alone has significant repercussions.    


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


Schulga has been the sole knight of the Kalingrad Barony. Ever since the previous old knight died, he has taken to himself to protect the family that sheltered and protected him.

He still remembered when he was just a wandering 18 years old. Exiled and thrown away by the "family" he had known, he wandered many kingdoms and lands. He once had great ambitions, to obtain great power and eventually go back to his former family and prove to them that they were wrong in abandoning him.

But fate is a cruel mistress, unforgiving to those she did not favour.

One day, as he starved at the streets, a couple had found him. The young baron Kalingrad and his late wife, carrying their five years old daughter. With great compassion, they took him and nursed him to health. They were unlike other nobles who only cared about their selfish wants. The couple loved and cared for the people and in turn, they too were loved by them. 

Touched by their noble hearts, that although they were meager, they did the best with what they had. And so Schulga made a decision, his journey had ended and this is where he will stay.

And ever since 12 years ago, he became the Kalingrad's family knight.

But something changed...

For one day, the beloved daughter of his master fell into a coma...

And woke up no longer herself.

Waking up in the morning, at 5:00 AM, Schulga would first wash his body with a wet towel and start his morning exercises. After an hour of training, he would wear his Knight's armor and go around patrolling the area, checking in on the borders, the villagers, the pier, and the border of the Cursed Forest.

It has been his habits for the past decade.

It was but a simple life, but Schulga enjoyed it. In this humble village everyone knew him and they all cared for one another. Schulga felt at home.

But his lady suddenly acted strange.

While he was patrolling the entrance border of the village, he heard news that his lady had gone missing for more than twelve hours.

And so, with his men, he took the warding stone from the Mansion treasury and began his search in the middle of the morning night.

This was not the first his lady had been lost in the Cursed Forest, Schulga thought. Perhaps she became curious again and got lost.

He tried telling himself that she'll be fine. But as the search grew deeper and deeper into the Cursed Forest and the dawn of light began shining bright, Schulga's heart grew tighter.

This was no longer normal. The search was dangerous, many times a monster had gone dangerously close to them, frightening his men. But under his leadership, they remained steadfast.

In a bid of desperation, Schulga broke the protocol.

"Spread out, search every leaf of any clues!"

"But Sir, If we spread out, the Warding stone will lose its efficacy..."

"Just go! Immediately cluster together if something feels wrong!"

He could no longer stay patient. Schulga knew deep inside that the chances of his lady being alive was practically zero. A fragile 17-year-old girl has no chance of surviving in the Cursed Forest.

But moments later... his men had found her.

Laying before a tree, he saw a badly wounded and blood covered Josephine. Seeing her in that state, Schulga's world shattered to pieces.

How could he ever face the kind Baron now?

As he shed his tears, Schulga was prepared to kill himself.

But suddenly, a miracle happened.

"... What the hell is wrong with you guys?"

He heard the familiar voice. And yet, it didn't feel familiar at all. It was cold, and completely lacking the gentleness that the lady he remember had

"... I'm not dead yet"

"... Stand up"

"... I need a bath"

It was completely illogical. It didn't make any sense. What happened to her? Why is her clothes completely torn apart? Why does she have such a cold pair of eyes?

And why does Schulga felt like he was kneeling before a King?

That regal feeling that Josee released, he didn't understand where it came from. And a day later, the inexplicable happened. He learned that his lady had been blessed with the power of Fire.

But it wasn't the fire that surprised him.

It was the keen and sharp intellect, the wisdom that she revealed. Not only that, her unfathomably powerful will. The lady he once knew was completely gone. All that was left was an extremely cruel woman who tortured the steward and sent him to his death.

And yet he couldn't find it in himself to hate her. Because even though Josephine had changed, one thing still remained the same.

Her love for her people.

Although she became ruthless, Josephine was still heavily concerned with her people and searched for ways to help them.

And now, just this morning, he had seen the farming method that his lady had invented and in just a whole day, Fredriech had created enough crop to feed the entire village.

In all of Schulga's life, he had never heard of such a method of farming. Even back in his original family,  they relied on serfs to rotate crops between farm lands, and even then, they never used magic to raise the crops. After all, who in the right mind would use a mage, a majestic being beyond civilians, as a farmer?

But his lady had done it. And not just any mage, she succeeded in making a former wizard into her farm boy.

Schulga didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

And this incident made Schulga realized.

A great change is about to come, and he will remain loyal.


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


Three days has passed, and Josee stared at the staggering digit in front of her. Not only was Fredriech hardworking, he even came up with ways to improve the yield.

First, he cast a water gathering enchantment spell on each mixture barrel to ensure water content. Then he also cast strengthening enchantment on each of the workers which gathers the ingredients for the nutrient solution. He also began experimenting with rye, wheat, and barley and began growing high yielding non-food crops solely for the purpose of converting excess nutrients into compost.

As a result, with Fredriech's large mana pool due to his former power, Josee now had a warehouse full to the brim with crops.

'... Holy shit', Josee sat at her office table with eyes shaking.

"... isn't this cheating? Why hasn't this been exploited yet? It's literally fucking broken. Fuck!", Josee excitedly cussed. No trace of elgance can be seen from her. It was as if she was a gangster from the streets.

After further calculation, Fredriech could produce 500 units of crop every day. He was more experienced than Josee at magic and such, Josee's five-minute growth was improved into two minutes.

Which meant, the warehouse south of the mansion was already full and Josee had ordered her men to build a new one.

"... This is fucking insanity", Josee muttered with wide opened eyes.

Although she had an idea, she realized that she heavily underestimated the potential of magic. Clams, Ash, manure, compost, magic. Everything was sustainable and replaceable within a short period of time. And if Josee managed to collect even the villagers shits, she would essentially create a net positive loop.

'... Shit. There's nothing magic cant do', Josee thought.

This time, she had truly outdone herself. She never intended to produce this much product. In fact there were so many created that at that rate they'd have a year worth of crops in just one month.

And so, a wicked smile broke in Josee's face.

"... I'll have to move my plans ahead"

It was unreasonable to store all the crops for themselves as they'd just rot. And so Josee called Alex over and had him describe her a potential market town where they can sell crops.

"... No. We can't sell in Port Bluewater. The merchants there are way too deep in noble pockets. They'd pry into our source. We can't do that"

"Then my lady, there's only one place I know"

Alex pointed at a city south of the map. An island between the southern kingdom and their Kalingrad territory was the Free City of Galile.

"This city is ruled by the adventurer's guild and pledges no allegiance to any kingdom", Alex explained, "because its at the sea, it always has a huge demand for crops"

"... I see, that's great to hear"

"But milady", Alex interjected, "I believe it would be for the best if we can get a reliable merchant who will distribute the crops for us. As our representative, they can hide our identity"

Josee thought for a moment before nodding her head.

"... That's reasonable, do you know anyone?"

"Well, not really. I've only apprenticed with the old steward, but I haven't left the village yet, haha"

"... I see"

Josee called for both Nadia, Fredriech, and Schulga and asked them if they know any reliable merchant, to which Schulga replied.

"Ah. I may know someone", Schulga thought for a moment.

"He's a friend of mine back when I was a mercenary. We regularly met when I accompanied the lord back in the capital"

"... Can he be trusted?", Josee inquired. Her eyes sharp.

"Yes", Schulga replied, "He has a good character. And cares deeply about the commoners. His only fault is that he's a womanizer and always gets duped by women"

"... Perfect", Josee clapped, "Contact him for me"

"Then, I will write a letter for him"

"... Oh, and Schulga. Make sure to hide our farming method from them", she explained, "I'm sure you understand why"

"Yes my lady!"

After warning him. Josee let the knight and the head maid leave, leaving only Fredriech.

"My lady", Fredriech spoke, seating at a chair before Josee's table.

"There's something I'd like to ask"

"... Speak freely", she commanded.

With furrowed eyebrows, Fredriech silently stared at Josee. She kept her hands moving on the parchment in her table, busy drawing and inscribing things that Fredriech could not understand.

He tightened his fist and asked.

"What exactly is the Great Cold?"

Josee stopped her hands, and for a moment, she paused. Laying her quill back to its inkwell, Josee leaned back into her chair and stared at Fredriech's eyes.

"... Your master learned of the Great Cold when he interpreted an ancient tablet in a ruin, right?"

Fredriech gulped his mouth.

'She even knew this'

"Yes. It said that it will extinguish all fire and freeze the word in a great darkness. That only the First Flame can resist it"

Josee stood up and picked her cup of tea. Slowly walking to the windows, she stared at the village below.

"... Your master misinterpreted the important part"

'... The great cold', Josee thought, 'When i read the novel, I also thought it was just an eternal winter. But the cave showed me otherwise'

"Yes?", Fredriech turned around and stared at the lonely figure of Josee.

"The Great Cold is not the problem", Josee sipped her tea.

"What?", Fredriech couldn't help but stand up. His heart began beating fast as if knowing he is about to hear something very important.

And Josee, slowly moved her eyes from the village, staring straight towards Fredriech's eyes.

"... The problem, is the cause of the Great Cold"

A thunder struck Fredriech's mind. His heart tightened and the hairs of his skin all stood up.

'Of course', Fredriech thought. How could he not have realized.

"W-What caused it?"

"... It's not what... ", Josee sipped her tea once more, "It's who. And there are many of them"

"W-What? What?", the memories of his master emerged back in his mind.  And suddenly,  he remembered the broken pieces of ancient murals that they unearth, and a certain image appeared in his mind.

On one of them depicts massive amount of people and on top of them was the symbol of a tsunami. It was at this moment that he realized.

That wasn't a tsunami.

"Those... those things",  Fredriech's sweat fell off his face.

"Are they... massive colossal beings?"

She paused for a moment, before looking into the far window.

"... Yes", Josee sipped her tea.

"... And I, will slaughter them all"

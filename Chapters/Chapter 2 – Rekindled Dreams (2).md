# Chapter 2 – Rekindled Dreams (2)

And from the ashes, arose a being, born from the will of a trillion dead souls, long forgotten and unknown.

A tiny ember, one that could fade with a single whisper of wind. And yet it remained strong, its Will unyielding and unbroken.

Josee opened her eyes.

She laid below in the steep grass of the forest. The light of the moon shined her face. She moved her nose, feeling the scent of ash. Quickly standing, her eyes rapidly observed her surrounding.

Finally, a realization dawned to her. She looked at her armor, her hands, chest, and legs, and she could see... fire.

Cracks appeared all over her body, the chasm of ember echoed from deep within her. Josee immediately rushed to a nearby pond. There, she grasped her face in shock.

Her formerly copper eyes had now turned into the shade of fire. Burning quietly as if there's molten lava within those irises.

Josee frowned. She opened her palm, and there it was... fire.

A fire burned humbly, like one which came from the roots of a stove.

"... But this is no ordinary fire", Josee noted.

She stood up and moved her eyes about, seeking for something. But suddenly, there was a roar.

The trees grew restless, and Josee immediately pulled her sword. She noticed that the embers of fire engulfed the sword.

And suddenly, a shadow stood tall before her. An ogre beast, standing 5 meters tall. On its right hand was a terrifying club, shaped from a tree. Its body was covered in thick muscles, small clusters of scales, and an animal hide covered its private parts.

Josee sharpened her gaze. She made eye contact with the single horrifying eyes that the beast wore.

"... An ogre", Josee gripped her sword.

The ogre beast swiftly swung its terrible club, prompting Josee to jump backwards. Her leather armor, almost scratched by the whip of the club.

Josee gnashed her teeth. The beast was rapid and swift, jumping and almost stomping her, she jumped to her side, rolling at the ground.

Immediately gaining her composure, Josee slashed backed at the ogre's legs, causing a spill of green blood.

"RARGGHH!", the ogre beast roared.

In a bid of fury, it turned around, and swung its club at her. But Josee was quick, squatting down to dodge it and dashing underneath the ogre. Her sword immediately piercing its bottom.

A blood curling scream came from the ogre beast, its eyes reddened by madness. Josee stood up, raising her ember sword, her eyes, rapidly searching for a weakness when suddenly, she felt a sharp pain on her body.

'... What?', Josee couldn't react fast enough.

She flew through the air, smashing straight into a tree and breaking it in half. Half her body caved in, her organs all but disintegrating.

"... Gah!", Blood spewed through Josee's mouth. Her eyes widened from the shock.

As she fell to the ground, the ogre beast walked forward. Its muscles bulging from deep fury.

"GRAGHH!!", the beast howled. It raised its club, and as Josee stared at it... she lightly chuckled. 

The ogre beast shattered her head, her brain matter spilling everywhere.

Seeing that its enemy laid dead, the ogre beast growled a few more times before turning its back and walking away.

And in this lonely forest, laid the corpse of a once noble lady. Her blood and guts, spilled everywhere.

But that was not the end.

In this deep darkness, underneath the bright moon sky, her body was slowly enveloped by fire. The fire grew increasingly intense, burning her whole body aflame.

And as the fire died down, Josee stood up. Her eyes, fiercely glaring forward. She walked forward, her hands reaching for her sword, and its embers lit up once more.

She glanced at it, its light reflecting her face. And that beautiful face of hers, suddenly broke into a mad smile.

"... Hahah... hahahaha", as the giggles left her mouth, Josee tensed her feet. She stepped forward, and began running where the ogre left.

"... Hahahahah!", and Josee madly laughed.

Her feet quickly evaded every roots and stones, every branch and trees. All for the sake of slaughter. And when her eyes caught sight of an ogre beast, walking, grunting through the forest, Josee recklessly jumped and stabbed its back.

"... Hahahahha!", the maniacal glint of madness shined in her eyes.

The ogre beast roared in pain. It dropped its club and reached for Josee who, skillfully slid down its back and continued stabbing.

"... Hahahahahah!!", but Josee simply kept stabbing. The foul blood of green, staining her face.

The ogre beast finally gave up and moved its body towards a tree. Josee pulled her sword, but suddenly, she found it stuck at the beasts back.

'It clenched its muscles?!', Josee frowned.

But that split second frown costed her life. The ogre beast slammed heavily to the tree, squashing Josee and spilling her organs.

As she fell down the tree, the Ogre beast kneeled to the ground. Breathing and bleeding, it fiercely glared at Josee.

But the flames would not be stoked. 

Flame engulfed Josee's body, arising once more. She opened her eyes, and slowly picked her sword. Her eyes, glaring with blight menace.

"... We are not over", And she wickedly smiled.

Upon seeing his felled enemy arise once more, the ogre beast instinctively took a step back.

Josee rushed forward. Her hands, learning from experience, tightly gripped the sword. The beast roared, bearing its terrible fangs. But Josee remained unfazed. 

The ogre beast slammed its arms towards her, but she swiftly dodged to her left, before thrusting her blade, digging deep into the ogre beasts' terrible eye.

"RAGGHRHH!!", the ogre roared. It tried grabbing Josee, but her swift eyes evaded, and she leaped upwards. Her blade that's embedded into the ogre's eye rotated a hundred eighty degrees, causing immense pain to the beast who stood up and struggled. Josee let go of her sword, landing on the beast's foul neck. 

She pulled a dagger from her hips, stabbing straight into the ogre's neck. Its green blood, bled everywhere. The beast then trashed, pushing and pulling Josee away. But every time its arms would reach for her, Josee would skillfully jump around its neck, continuously stabbing, inflicting horrifying pain.

"... Die!", Josee madly laughed, striking the dagger once more into its neck. The ogre beast, confused and roaring, pulled the sword from his eye and with all its strength, slammed it into Josee.

She was caught off-guard by the sudden rush of the blade, causing her to stumble and fall into the ground. Josee immediately stood up, but the ogre seized the opportunity and slammed her head into a thousand fractured pieces, killing her instantly. The furious, maddened beast did not stop. It kept punching Josee's body, even reaping it in half and slamming them both to a nearby rock.

As the ogre beast exhaled, it felt weak. It suddenly collapsed to its knees, the blood gushing out of its body made its remaining eye to blur. It groaned in pain, covering the back of its neck with its right hand.

But the flames would not be stoked. 

The two severed parts of Josee burned to ashes, amalgamating into a single entity. The ogre beast stared in horror. Despite its brute strength, it bears significant intelligence. And it knew.

She could not be killed.

Josee opened her eyes. As she stood before the ogre beast, her body completely naked. 

She slowly picked her sword that's been flayed to her side.

Fire gathered and set the sword in quiet embers.

And Josee wickedly smiled.

"... Hahha.... HAHAHAHAHAHA!", maddened by bloodlust, Josee laughed.

The foul beast gnashed its teeth. It picked its club and menacingly glared at Josee. Their eyes interlocked, both maddened by battle.

"RRAGHHHHHH!", the ogre howled once more. Its body, constantly bleeding from dozens of wounds inflicted by Josee.

And so, it rushed her, entering a completely berserk state. But Josee did not dodge, for she too rushed forward.

The giant ogre slammed its club with the full weight of his body, a slam that would undoubtedly kill her. But as it neared her, Josee's crimson eyes glinted, and she quickly stepped to her right, narrowly but precisely dodging the incoming attack.

Earth rumbled, and the trees shook. The stones and debris flew everywhere and in that infinitesimal moment, their eyes glared at one another. 

And from the deepest depth of Josee's soul, an instinct suddenly called.

The flame surged within Josee's ember sword. Instantly growing in size. And with one precise stroke, she struck her blade right into the Ogre beast's head, penetrating it with one deep strike!

Flames pierced through the skull, creating a straight arc of crimson through the forest.

And so at last, her mighty and terrible foe... has fallen.

The sound of its body falling to the ground echoed through the forest, its giant, muscular corpse laid in silence. 

Josee lowered here sword, and she walked on top of the corpse. 

Laying there alone, with this cursed forest, was a naked woman madly smiling and laughing.

"... I won! I fucking won! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"

And with a crazy smile, Josee stared at her sword. Burning brightly within this dark forest, it gave her a gentle and warm feeling, as if a mother embracing its daughter.

As she stared into those flames, as if a reminder of whom those powers belonged to, she saw the memories of those that came before, of a futile war with all but an inevitable end.

"... I see", Josee spoke softly,

"... The Flames of Cinder", she stared at those lonely flames burning in her blade.

"... Oh, power of the forgotten ones", Josee softly declared, "Rest with silence, for I shall put thy's old wishes to use"

And Josee's face broke into an almost childish, wicked smile.

"... And protect your world"


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


The sun hangs high into the sky, and a group of men dared the cursed forest of the Kalingrad territory.

"Move out! Men, are there any news yet?"

Within the outskirts of the Cursed Forest, a knight led his soldiers, spreading everywhere searching for someone.

"Sir Schulga, we found traces of footsteps!", a guard wearing a worn-out and brown, brigandine armor exclaimed.

The knight, wearing his full body armor, turned to the soldier and commanded.

"Men! Follow the footsteps! We must find the lady as soon as possible!", the panic and worry was heard from Schulga's voice.

As the only Knight sworn to the Kalingrad family, it is his duty to lay his life down to protect the family. But that duty is now in jeopardy as the only heir of the family has gone missing.

'Dammit!', Schulga worriedly ran, following his guards through the thick and dense forest. Each guard carried a purple stone in their hands, emitting a strange purple light.

'The lady's been gone for a whole day', Schulga gnashed his teeth.

'A defenseless woman. I'm afraid... dammit I must hope! Why was I patrolling the borders when the lady woke up!?'

Their reckless search, no doubt alarmed the resident monsters living within the desolate forest. But the purple stones emitted from the guard's hands carried a hue which the monsters avoided.

"Men!", Schulga shouted, gaining the attention of the forty guards.

"Spread out, search every leaf of any clues!", Schulga commanded.

"B-But sir", a guard raised his concern. His voice, trembling.

"I-If we spread out, the Warding stone will lose its efficacy..."

"Just go! Immediately cluster together if something feels wrong!", Schulga shouted.

He knew of the dangers of separating. But his loyalty cannot allow failure. He must find his lady, no matter what.

And so, the party dissipated, creating a wider search net. The search goes further, and a dozen minute passed when suddenly, a guard shouted.

"Sir Schulga! We found the lady!", the guard announced with glee.

Hearing this, Schulga immediately ran towards the location of that guard. Upon entering a clearing, he saw his men kneeling and looking at a woman seating by a tree.

And as Schulga saw this, he couldn't help but tightly close his eyes.

"Milady!", he slowly walked forward.

Seating on the tree, with her eyes closed was Josee. Her armor was completely torn apart with a few pieces hanging here and there, revealing her body filled with blood and muck.

She sat there, as if she was simply sleeping.

"No... No!", Schulga fell down. He took his knight's helmet off, revealing a man in his 30s. His white long pony-tail was blown by the wind. As he stared at Josee's lifeless body, his dark eyes trembling and hollowed.

The guards looked in silence. Their skin went pale, many shut their eyes. In spite of how poor their territory was, the baron has always treated his people right. And to see his daughter laying there dead, broke their heart.

The sound of weepings can be heard. Some guards couldn't hold it in and quietly cried.

But suddenly, a voice that they shouldn't have heard resounded. A very feminine and soft voice that sounded almost annoyed.

"... What the hell is wrong with you guys?", Josee spoke out loud. Her crimson eyes twitching at the sight of her men, crying and weeping at her wake.

'... You're a bunch of grown men. Why are you crying so passionately like little girls?', thinking of this, Josee touched her glabella.

"... I'm not dead yet"

Like lightning, her words woke all the guards back to reality. Specially so to Schulga who was crying rivers of tears.

"W-What?", his eyes widened. Seeing Josee's state, she seemed almost full of life as she stood up, like nothing happened to her.

'Cold and firm eyes. What? Is this really the lazy and feminine lady I've known throughout these years?', Schulga gulped.

"... Stand up", Josee commanded.

"... I need a bath"


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


The sun stood high in the sky, and the Kalingrad household is in disarray after finding their lady completely covered in blood.

Within the bathroom of the humble and small Kalingrad Mansion, Josee sat inside a large wooden bathtub, filled with clean water.

She moved her hands around her body, from her face to her chest and to her lower parts. 

'... No wounds nor scars', Josee stared at her right hand. It was perfectly clean, as if nothing had ever touched it.

'... The fire also dulls the pain. But it still exists, not as much'

Josee recalled the long night she had. A lone woman rushed through the forest like a complete lunatic. She fought giant beasts, hulking ogres, crawling man-eating centipedes, and packs of forest hyenas all by herself. Eventually, her entire armor was completely ripped to shreds and her sword, broken to pieces.

"... Sigh...", she deeply exhaled. Resting her hands and body into the water, Josee calmly stared at the ceiling.

'... Not good', Josee thought.

'... I must be careful, or I'll get completely lost to the bloodlust again... it was fun though'

Josee opened her right palm, and a flame of warm orange emerged.

She remembered the original story.

"… It was… a work of satire, a mockery of the genre. As the characters were all busy with their romantic life and bullshit, the world around them slowly started crumbling apart… ", Josee frowned. She forced herself to remember what little detail she could find in her mind.

And as she recalled these memories, a frown filled her face.

Josee deeply inhaled, and slowly sighed in tiredness.

"… *And a lone warrior struggled, fighting against the evil that descended. Alone and weak, he fought to the end, a one-man war to protect the world he loved*…", Josee grit her teeth.

It was a single line. The only line that mentioned the existence of a hero… and yet…

"… That damned story… the world was never about the reverse harem romance", Josee cruelly frowned.

"… It was just a minor story, a backdrop against a slowly crumbling world. A story about human greed, vanity, and narcissism. The failure to see the world for what it really is and the indifference to the suffering of the people"

And Josee remembered the man who stood at the end.

"...A story where only a single lone hero rose but failed to save the world… tsk"

Josee remembered all the artefacts, all the mcguffin and magical items that were found throughout the story but were inevitably never used to their full potential.

'... I suppose it was the author's way of reinforcing the theme. Where these great artefacts were use for nothing but vain purposes'

"… If only the hero had those things, maybe he could've saved this world"

But the hero did not have any of those, for he fought even without any blessings.

He was a lone hero.

Josee stood up, revealing her humble but curvaceous body. She walked towards the small window and saw the state of her territory.

'... I need to find that Hero. I don't know who or what he is, but I must find him', she made her resolve as she stepped out of the large bucket tub.

'... This is my life now... There is no point in complaining'

A glint of determination formed within Josee's eyes.

''... I must do what must be done"


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


It was noon in the afternoon, and Josee can hear the cries of birds flying from the seas.

Within the master's office of the Kalingrad household, Josee sat at the center table with her key personnel standing in front.

Josee wore a humble, white dress that reached her ankles. Her light brown hair was tied in a ponytail, with a little bang gliding over her forehead. Swiftly, she drafted some writings in a piece of parchment.

Her servants, head maid, steward, knight, and chief guard all stood before her in silence. Their faces sported a frown as did their dried mouth. Their focused on the one thing that most disturbed them, Josee's eyes.

The servants and their parents, and the parents of their parents had served the Kalingrad family for many generations. Thus, they knew well that a Kalingrad descendant would have a pair of lustrous copper eyes. Humble the appearance may it be, it was the blood of the noble family.

And yet, Josee had a pair of bright, crimson eyes.

But it wasn't just the eyes.

'Her demeanor, her personality, her charisma, and her intellect. All of it completely changed when milady woke up from her coma', Schulga frowned.

'What exactly happened. Who is this woman in front of me. And earlier...', the white-haired Schulga remembered when he and his men rescued Josee.

She was covered in blood and gore and her armor was completely ripped to pieces, almost exposing her private parts. And yet, Josee stood up and walked casually like nothing happened.

'It's not just that', Schulga recalled, 'It's strange... but there was hardly any beast when we approached the forest. Why?'

"... Nadia", Josee remarked. Placing down her quill and staring right into the head maid's eyes.

"... The town houses right now... ", Josee spoke softly," are in destitute because of a recent storm, correct?"

"Ah!", the old lady made a quiet shriek. Suddenly caught off guard by Josee, her trembling became apparent. One of the maids walked forward and caress' the old lady's back, comforting her.

"Y-Yes", Nadia exclaimed, "Most of the houses were old and fragile, so the storm swept a lot of them away"

"... I see. And why have we not fixed it?", Josee asked.

"Well. There are many factors", Nadia swept the sweat off her forehead.

"The sea is their main source of income. So the villagers prioritized building boats that were destroyed rather than houses. Also, all the outskirt trees from the cursed forest had been felled. If the villagers go further, they attract the attention of powerful beast. The lord has used his last coins to buy grains from count Rotweiss to feed the villagers. He's the only one willing to trade with us"

"... I see", Josee noted. She thought for a moment before opening her eyes.

"... But that makes no sense", Josee noted, "How did they sustain themselves for generations if they relied on the outskirt trees? It would all have been felled eventually"

"Well... ", Nadia continued, "We take our trees from the forest near Count Rotweiss' border but, due to the war in the north, the Count forbid us from taking trees since he's busy building catapults for the King"

"... Oh", Josee flinched.

'... Fuck, there was a war? The novel didn't mention that'

"... With whom are we waging war again?", Josee casually asked.

"The Kingdom of Habsvar", Nadia replied, "I've always wondered. The Habsvar is our King's cousin. Why are they fighting?"

"... Because they're retarded", upon hearing Josee's words, the servants flinched.

She turned over her eyes to Schulga who flinched when his eyes met Josee's gaze.

"... Schulga. If we stabbed warding stones in the perimeter of the forest, would that prevent monsters from coming close?"

Realizing  that his lady was trying to come up with a solution, Schulga's eyes turned serious. Momentarily pushing back his questions, he replied.

"In theory, yes", Schulga replied, "But we would need a warding stone every one meter. I believe if we cover a kilometer of perimeter, it would be sufficient"

"... I see... and how much is a warding stone", Josee asked while writing in her parchment.

"A hundred gold each", Schulga firmly replied. Hearing the numbers, the other servants gulped down.

"... How do we have 40 of them then", Josee asked while resting her chin between her hands.

"They were family relics", Schulga closed his eyes, "Your family has been gathering them for generations. Bit by bit as a way of protecting ourselves from the monsters. Fortunately, they do not leave their land unless disturbed"

"... I see", Josee nodded.

Josee paused for a moment and quickly calculated the amount needed in her mind.

"... We will need a hundred thousand gold if we want to construct that"

Everyone in the room immediately widened their eyes. Schulga, specifically opened his mouth.

'How did she calculate it that quick?', Schulga frowned.

"... Hmm", Josee grumbled.

'... Importing wood is not practical. There's plenty of local wood, but we can't access it'

Josee then turned over to Schulga.

"... In your opinion, what's the most pressing issue of our people right now"

"Most pressing issue", Schulga closed his eyes. Everyone in the room turned to him.

After thinking for a few moments, he opened his eyes and declared.

"That would be our food supply and that we have to make a sacrifice to the Divines"

And as soon as Josee heard this, she immediately frowned.

'... The fuck?'

"... Explain yourself", Josee asked with seriousness.

"Yes! Currently, the unrest caused by the sea leviathan, Cetarax led to fishes leaving the area, causing fewer fish to be caught. So we are relying on the rations bought by the lord to sustain the village. But it won't last long. And Summer is coming near. It is during this time when the god of pestilence, Nurgothor wakes up and spreads diseases. We have to make a sacrifice to the gods and pray to give us divine protection, so the people do not suffer from illnesses"

'... Oh', Josee half-closed her eyes.

'... I see. The warm weather must be fostering insects and causing food to go bad quickly which causes more disease'

And when she thought  of Cetarax, she couldn't help but place her palm on her face.

'... And Cetarax. Fuck. How am I gonna kill that fucker right now? Impossible', Josee deeply sighed. The servants saw the distress in their lady and couldn't help but feel bad for her.

Josee puts down her hand before looking at Schulga.

"... I see. Thank you for your opinion", Josee nodded before turning to Nadia.

"... Nadia, how often do people bath?"

"Ah, yes?", Nadia lightly blinked her eyes, wondering why her lady was asking something so obvious.

"Well", Nadia gulped, "Only a few times a year on rivers. We often just soak lufa-sponges in well waters and brush ourselves"

"... I see", Josee nodded her head.

After thinking for a moment, she stood up and walked towards the window. Opening it wide, the salty sea air entered, giving them a refreshing breeze.

Josee observed the port. Only a dozen boats and two fishing ships can be seen.

'... I have to fix the houses, fix the hygiene, fix the food problem, and also urgently need to get warding stones', Josee raised her right hand and bit the nail of her thumb.

'... With the Flame of Cinder no longer in that cave, it's only a matter of time till the monsters go rampaging. I know this from the knowledge the flame passed onto me. Fuck'

"... Sighhh", Josee shook her head.

'... I was too careless'

Josee turned around, looking at her servants who are curiously looking at her.

'... No matter. We must first fix the food issue. There isn't much land to farm in this place due to the expansive cursed forest'

Her eyes then deeply focused.

'... As much as possible, I'd rather not waste gold on a resource that we can technically grow. Which means... '

Josee turned over to a boy, no older than seventeen, standing at the back of the room.

"... Alex"

"Y-Yes!!", the boy walked forward. His movement were stiff, and his hands were trembling. He lowered his head, hiding the sweat off his face.

The new steward of the family.

He was there when Josee brutally treated the last steward, and so as the new one, he knew well to keep himself in line.

"How many are our citizens right now", Josee asked.

"Eh, well", the steward then took his notebook and flipped the pages.

"6-653!"

Josee frowned.

'... Hmmm...650. Too small. For my future projects, I will have to import people'

"... I see", Josee then tapped her feet.

"... How long can our rations last?"

"Ah.. Err... approximately... ", and then, Alex's face turned grimed.

"At this rate. Well...", Alex hesitated for a moment.

"... Out with it", Josee commanded.

"Yes!", Alex swiped the sweat off his face.

"T-The former steward informed the lord that the rations will last for two more months... but"

Hearing the former steward, everyone's face immediately darkened. They immediately knew it was bad news.

"I counted our inventory again and based on my assessment... Less than a month", hearing this, the servants all gasped in shock.

Schulga deeply frowned.

"... I see", Josee nodded.

"... Well, I should have tortured that fucker more before I had him hanged"

'.... Hmmm', she raised her right hand and pinched her glabella.

'... Fuck. This is more dire than I imagined. How the fuck did these assholes lived this long?'

As she kept touching her glabella, Josee deeply exhaled. An exhale which also stressed every servants in the room, finally understanding the gravity of the situation.

'... Hmmm'

"... Sighhhhhhhhh", Josee deeply exhaled once more. This time lasting more than three seconds as she pinched her head. The servants remained silent, almost feeling the same level of stress Josee was feeling.

"M-Milady", Nadia bitterly smiled. The old head maid then spoke.

"T-The baron is currently trying to find a solution. Y-You don't have to stress yoursel-", but her words were cut off.

"... No", Josee stared at her eyes.

"... Father will fail. This territory has no value, in sea or in land. We have to solve this ourselves. No sane person would invest", Josee shook her head before returning to her seat.

"B-But", Nadia curled her eyebrows.

"W-What are we going to do?", she asked with trepidation in her heart.

"My-My lady", Alex stepped forward, "Should we, write a letter to the baron?"

"... No", Josee replied.

"... The Baron will only make reckless decisions if he learned our state. He must not know. I can resolve this"

"W-What should we do then?", Alex asked.

Josee then softly replied.

"... Bring me the local carpenters and blacksmiths"

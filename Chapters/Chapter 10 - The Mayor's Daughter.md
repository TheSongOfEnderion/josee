# Chapter 10  - The Mayor's Daughter

With 25 gold in Josee's hand, she obtained a good profit from this transaction.

With the transaction complete, Bolli left with two other guards to begin transferring the crate goods to the Seven-Tree warehouse.

As for Josee, she began heading to the magic district within Galile.

'Once I obtain enough warding stones and explore the inner parts of the cursed forest, theoretically, it should have a mine of some sort inside since it has a large mountain that separates it from Brytoria.'

Looking at the glass panels of many magic shops, Josee saw a variety of equipment and tools.
But when Josee looked at the cost of each magic tool, each of them was 5 Gold at minimum.

"The fuck?" Josee cursed.

"Those are just the basics, milady," Schulga pointed out while looking at a magic tool behind the glass panel.

"A small tool that can barely make a small fire, or a wind fan that can create a very minor gust of winds. These are most likely made by students. The really good ones, like a fire sword, can reach 100 Gold in price, minimum."

Thinking about such a powerful enchanted artifact, Schulga couldn't help but sigh.

"Shit," Josee bit her thumbnail, "It's a complete fucking scam."

"Haha," Schulga wryly smiled, "But milady, is there anything you need? Although Friedrich said enchantment wasn't his specialty, I'm sure he can make something better than any of these shops has to offer."

"True," Josee nodded.

"Anyway, I'm not interested in these things anymore."

The two then walked forward, towards the center of the city.

While walking, Schulga couldn't help but ask, "Milady," he spoke while carefully observing the crowded street.
"Where are we going now that we got the crop contract?"

"We will need a ship," Josee softly replied, "A large ship."

"Hmm? But milady," Schulga wryly smiled, "A large ship will cost at least 500 gold. And even then, no ship comes without a crew of 30 people, and then you need to pay them too. Overall, you'll spend 1000 gold minimum."

"Huh?" Josee lightly giggled. A wicked smile formed on her face, "Who said I was going to pay for it?"

"What?" Schulga frowned in confusion.

Somehow, his heart tightened, a dreadful feeling crept through his back.

The Free City of Galile.

It was a city that was constantly visited in the novel until it was destroyed by a war.

The truth is, the Free City of Galile was run by three powerful families, each taking turns ruling the place as mayor every five years. These families, however, were practically a single clan due to the constant intermarriage between them, ensuring stable, secure, and balanced power distribution.

This time, it was the Pedonas Family's turn to rule as Mayor.

And the current head of the Family, Griald Pedonas, was suffering from depression due to his daughter's sickly condition. For some reason, she grew up with a curse that made her immobile most of the day, and when she reached her 15th birthday, she permanently fell into a coma.

Originally, the main heroine would come and break the curse from the Pedonas daughter, healing her to health.

Utterly grateful for her help, the Pedonas Mayor would reward Celine with a powerful ring artifact.

His daughter would then become a loyal follower of Celine and choose to become her personal maid.

Naturally, of course, such an event would no longer happen.

'A fucking artifact as a reward from THE mayor of the Free City of Galile? Were your brains made of tofu-dreg construction?'
Josee rolled her eyes as they walked towards the mansion of the Pedonas Family.

'I don't need something as useless as a protective ring. No, I want something even better,' and so Josee wickedly smiled.

After walking for a few minutes, the two arrived at an expansive metal gate filled with intricate designs. A guard stood at the gate. Halting Josee and Schulga, the guard asked, "Halt, what business do you have with the mayor's mansion?"

Stepping forward, Josee softly replied, "I am Josee Kalingrad of Brytoria's Kalingrad family. Tell the lord that I have the ability to cure his daughter's illness."

After hearing her, the guard sighed. He turned a wry look at Josee, a woman wearing a red skirt and a white long-sleeved blouse. She dressed neatly and was even accompanied by a knight. And yet, how could such a woman be able to cure the mayor's daughter? She didn't even look like she had seen life's hardships. She was probably just a con artist, the guard thought.

"Sigh..." the guard raised his eyes to Josee, "you're another one of those who claim to be able to cure the Lord's daughter, and yet it's all the same. Look, if you really are the genuine article, why don't you go to the mayor's office first and authenticate your power, eh?"

Josee inwardly heaved a sigh upon hearing this guard's disrespectful words. Hearing his disrespect, Schulga frowned deeply.

Josee half-closed her eyes before moving her hands. Suddenly, a gold coin fell to the ground. "Oh my," Josee covered her mouth with her right hand. The guard turned to look and also saw the gold fall down. His eyes widened at the glint of gold.

Josee knelt down and picked up the gold. "A gold coin. I don't own this. Maybe it belongs to you, sir guard?" Josee whispered while quickly handing over the gold to the guard. With a cold face, the guard looked left and right, then pocketed the gold.

"Oh, it's Lady Josephine of the Kalingrad family!" the guard brightly smiled. His tone of voice completely changed. 

"You came to visit the Lord, yes? You can cure his daughter? Very well. I'll head inside and inform the Lord."

Opening the gate, the guard quickly left towards the mansion. Josee peeked over the gate and saw five other guards guarding and patrolling the courtyard. Each of the guards were wearing bluish-green scale armor made from Marman cyan scales.

"Milady," Schulga frowned, "is it really worth it to give gold to that guard?"

"Hmm? Of course not," Josee lightly smiled, "a sleazy person like that does not deserve kindness. I'll get it back."

"Hmm... but, milady. Can you really heal the lord's daughter?", Schulga tapped his right foot.

Schulga didn't pay much attention to the politics of the world, but even he had heard of the Free City of Galile's mayor who offered a great deal of fortune  to any that could cure his daughter. That was years ago and still nobody could succeed.

"... Hah?", Josee raised her left eyebrow, "I can recreate a wizard's broken plate. A mere curse is nothing"

"Oh. Well, that makes sense", Schulga nodded.

Josee rolled her eyes. But at the corner of her sight, she saw how Schulga always had his hand at his sword's hilt.

Suddenly from the large, blue roofed mansion, a man walked out with great haste.  He was a man in his late 60's, wearing a particular kaiser beard. He was a bit plump and hunched, and wore a dark robe with a cyan sash.

"Greetings", the man corteously bowed.

In return, Josee lightly raised her skirt and similarly bowed.

The man lightly raised his eyebrows. Observing Josee's dress and Schulga's knight armor, he lightly bowed.

"i am Jorgen, Steward of thr Pedonas Family"

"Josephine Kalingrad, Daughter of Baron Kalingrad of the Brytoria Kingdom"

Seeing her graceful light bow, the steward nodded.

"Come, follow me to the mansion"

Josse nodded and Jorgen led the way. Schulga turned his eyes left and right, quietly observing the surroundings.

'With milady's strange powers, i guess healing a single child would be a breeze'

The three entered the wide mansion door. Stepping inside, their eyes saw the expansive mansion hall, decorated by clean velvet carpets, white ivory walls guilded with gold, and intricate sea pattern in dark wood shade decorating the walls. Josee looked up and saw the large chandeliers, giving a calming bright light.

'... even the chandeliers were powered by mana stones. What a fucking waste'

The steward then walked them to the right side of the hall. They entered a drawing room with two soft green sofa inside, intricate wall papers, and a nice dark wood table by the center.

At the corner of the room, a servant wearing a dark robe quietly stood.

"Please, take a seat"

At the stewards beckoning, Josee and Schulga sat opposite of thr steward Jorgen.

"I am sorry, but I will get straight to business", Jorgen lightly bowed, an apologetic look formed in his eyes.

"... Go ahead", Josee replied. She crossed her legs and leaned her body forward.

"As the mayor of the famous city, we receive plenty of would be healers. To sort out the fake and the real one, we devised a test to prevent any harm from happening"

The butler snapped his finger and a servant entered through the back door, pushing a tray filled with cages of small animals. From a wounded rat, a sick kitten, and dismembered lizard, and a bleeding chicken. All of them were tied to prevent scuffling.

Placing the tray at the side, the butler continued.

"Please", with his right arm out, he explained, "heal these animals first to prove you really are a healer"

"... Hmm", Josee lightly glanced at the animals. A frown appeared in her face as she saw the pain in their faces.

Schulga merely quietly observed, his hand still tightly grasping the sword and scabbard placed on his legs.

"... Very well", Josee sighed.

Suddenly, Josee graciously and slightly raised her right hand. The room seem to darken a bit as an ember light surrounded Josee. 

The warm fire embraced her body, yet it did not burn anything.

Jorgen's eyes widened at the sight of the Cinder Flames. But his opened mouth shut in a hurry as panic filled his face.

"GUARDS!"

Swiftly, the doors from the front and back were suddenly fling open as dozens of guards entered the room with sword held in their hands.

Schulga also reacted and swiftly pulled his sword, pointing it at the steward.

"Milady!", he shouted.

"Lady Josephine, what is the meaning of this!?", Jorgen stepped back quickly and hid behind the sofa. Guards immedaitely came over and shielded him, their swords pointed at her.

"... Relax, you bunch of idiots", Josee rolled her eyes. As the room grew tense every second, Josee remained seated. She flicked her right hand, and the flames, like gaseous water, poured itself into the animals. The warm, and dim light filled the room with a melancholic comfort that almost lessened the tension.

The flames embraced the animals. The wounds of the rat closed, the meowing kitten purred, the dismembered lizard grew its legs, and the bleeding chicken stood up with great vigor.

As Jorgen watched this, his eyes widened in shock. Josee then pulled back the flames of cinder and the darkness light disappeared, as if there was no flame before.

"... Done", Josee gracefully flicked her hair.

Jorgen gulped down. He remained stoned there, watching the animals wriggle around the cage in good health.

"... What?", Josee scoffed coldly, "Were you hired to waste everyone's time?"

"Huh? Ah, yes!", Jorgen pulled his handkerchief and wiped the sweat off his forehead.

"... Schulga, sheathe your sword", Josee commanded. Seeing the situation, Schulga understood her intention and slowly sheathed his sword.

Seeing this, Jorgen waved his hand, "Everyone, lay your sword"

After sheating their weapon, the guards around Jorgen stepped aside as he went and inspected each of the four animals.

A few moments passed and he gasped in breath.

"I can't believe this. What strange magic is this? Only a grand sorcerrer could heal these animals this quick!"

But Josee did not reply and merely stared at the window outside. Lightly closing her eyes, she fell into thoughts. She opened her eyes again and stared at the ceiling where she saw a louvre.

'... It's not a surprise that air-conditioning was invented in this world. With the existence of enchantment magic, one only need an ice spell, a wind spell, and a tremendous amount of mana stone. All of which aren't a problem to a rich bastard'

"... So?", Josee coldly replied, "Can we make this quick?"

"T-Then, I'll need to call the mayor firs-", but Jorgen was cut-off when Josee sharply spoke.

"... No, we don't have time"

"Yes? What do you mean?"

"... His daughter should die any moment soon", Josee yawned as if she spoke something irrelevant.

Hearing this, Jorgen deeply frown. A certain anger filled his heart, but he pushed it down. 

"How can you say that? What proof do you have?", With a heavy voice he asked.

"... Spots appeared in her body, right?". Josee then looked at her right hand's fingers.

'... They're not pretty at all. I should buy some nail polish later'

Upon hearing Josee's remarked, Jorgen deeply frowned.

"Yes. How. Did you know?"

"... Err, she's been in coma for two years", Josee then stood up, stretching her body, "The degradation of the Umbraic Curse would create dark spots in her body as well as deep dark veins. Soon it'll create puss and by then not even Ancestral Saints can heal her"

Jorgen's eyes widened. His body shivered at Josee's words.

'It's true', Jorgen grit his teeth, 'Milady's body has began growing dark spots and dark veins. So, we really don't have much time?'

"You say its a curse?", Jorgen stepped forward, his thoughts were in shambles.

"... Yeah", Josee rolled her eyes, "Why else would the saint's healing won't work. It's not an illness, it's killing her soul"

"H-Herr, soul!?", Jorgen's face became flushed red. His body shivered at the thought. Although he was not a mage, he was knowledge at the basics of the world of magic.

And he knew of the soul arts, and the horror it does to its victims.

'So, it was a soul art. No wonder no one could heal her, curse us fools!'

"... So?", Josee crossed her arms, "My patience is running out and your little lady is dying"

"P-Please just wait", Jorgen turned his gaze directly at Josee's crimson eyes, "I shall immediately have the mayor called her-"

"... No", Josee replied with deep cold eyes, "We heal her now or your lady dies an agonizing death. Take it, or leave it. Your choice"

A tension filled the air. Jorgen clenched his fist as his eyes shivered in confusion.

Of course, Josee was bulshiting him. The mayor's daughter will survive for a year and a half just fine until the Heroine meets her.

'... But why the fuck would I waste time waiting? You think the mayor can just leave his office whenever he wants? That'll take atleast 30 damn minutes', Josee internally rolled her eyes.

Schulga observed what they were talking about in silence. As they talked back and forth earlier, his eyes went left and right watching them. Somehow, Schulga felt entertained at what was happening that he started rubbing his chin with his left hand.

The guards behind were also quietly watching, they stood fixed. An anticipation filled their eyes, a certain hope for someone's salvation. 

Everyone's eyes were onto Jorgen, awaiting his decision. As the pressure of the surrounding increase, Josee yawned again and began walking out.

"... Let's go home", Josee crossed her arms.

"Yes", Schulga stood up.

Thinking deep inside, Schulga was impressed by his noble lady.

'Considering Milady's personality, she definitely couldn't stand waiting. Walking out of the room while the target is making a decision, how brilliant!'

"Wait!", Jorgen shouted. His breath a bit haggard.

Josee stopped in her tracks without even bothering to look behind.

A few moments passed and Jorgen finally spoke.

"Fine. Please. Heal our poor lady!"

"... Sigh", Josee pretended to sigh and turned around. Her eyes making contact with Jorgen's.

"... Lead the way"


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


It was as if the song of ancients echoed through the dimly lit room. The warm orange light of the cinder flames gently embraced a poor girl, lying in a large bed.

Her blonde hair, pearly white skin, and thin body made one feel sorry for the miserable child.

A disgusting and almost pimple-like dark spots filled her body. The dark veins in her arms and legs pulsed like flesh meat. And in her face was a pained expression as if she was being tortured.

But her expression of pain soon eased.

The flames engulfed her, gently carressing her and burning the darkness away.

Jorgen watched as Josee cast her flames onto their mistress. Seeing the dark spots slowly grow smaller, the veins fading, and the pain in her face disappeared, Jorgen could no longer stop himself from crying.

"Our poor young lady...", the old man wiped his eyes with his arm, crying loudly as if he was a boy.

Schulga watched from the side, his eyes curiously widened at the sight. Glancing to his right, a woman in a blue robe held her wand in place. 

'That's the Pedonas Family's mage', Schulga observed her. Her bountiful figure were seen through the curvy robe, but her face were hidden by the hood, only showing her braided orange hair.

Josee continued burning the curse, but as the dark spots were almost all disappearing, a sudden tremor filled the room.

The hair within jorgen's, Schulga's, and the Pedonas Family's mage all stood up.

"W-What was that?", the mage grit her teeth.

"Milady? Milady!", Schulga shouted in worry. 

Jorgen trembled and merely stared at his young lady's body.

It was at that moment, when a shadow, dark hand creeped from her heart. As if a portal was opened, the dark hand extended long almost five meters in length.

Everyone in the room stared at the dark shadowy hand. Their mouths wide opened at the terrifying entity that appeared.

"... Ah", Josee lightly spoke. Even Josee's crimson eyes widened, unware of what was happening.

'... You're shitting me', Josee sighed in a quiet exasperation, 'What the fuck is that thing?'

The hand moved forward. It pointed itself at Josee and at lightning speed grabbed her neck and slammed her to the opposite side of the room ten meters away.

Josee immediately coughed blood as the dark hand strangled her.

"Milady!!", Schulga's neck tightened as he immediately drew his sword to slice the arm off. But his metal sword merely passed through as if the hand was not there.

"Arina!", Jorgen shouted the mage's name. His heart beating widly.

'What's happening?! Where did that dark hand come from?!'

The mage raised her right arm and immediately, a yellow magic circle came to her hand, casting a holy light towards the dark shadowy entity.

But as the light came towards the dark entity, it did not do anything.

"What?!", Arina immediately cast a binding spell but it merely passed by, binding a random chair instead.

"Milady!", Schulga's heart tigtened as he ran towards the hands. Knowing the arms would not bulge, he rushed towards the very hands itself.

"... Sit down Schulga", but Josee's command caused him to pause.

Moving her head around, Josee's eyes revealed a flaming glow. A flame was erected around her neck, preventing the dark entity from stranggling her.

Suddenly, eight more hands came from the young girl's body and soon grasped Josee's limbs with great force that it broke her bones. The blood escaped through cracks from her skin, making everyone in the room visibly cringe from the pain.

"By the gods", Jorgen seethed in fear.

"Milady!", Schulga shouted as he tried to hack at the dark hands to no avail.

'Shit. It's not working!', Schulga bit on his lips. His furious eyes seethed in pain. 

'If only I can use Aura! Goddamnit!'

But the Flames of Cinder quickly burned through her flesh, mending her bones.

"... ah you fucking pile of cow shit", Josee's right arm violently ripped through the dark entitty's grasp. Her right hand then immediately took hold of the shadowy hand that held her neck.

With anger in her eyes, Josee deeply frowned, and the gentle and warm fire that surrounded her suddenly turned Turbid and Violent.

"... Fuck off", Josee coldly replied, maliciously burning the long dark shadowy hands. A wretching scream suddenly filled the room, emitting from the portal like shadow in the young girl's chest.

Everyone's hair stood up.

The creepy and harrowing scream continued as if tortured by a thousand serrations.

Through this all, Josee merely stared with a blank coldness.

# Chapter 8

During her meeting with Friedrich, he explained about fire runes.

"My apologies, milady," Friedrich admitted. "Runes aren't my area of expertise. I can create a basic fire rune, but its heat wouldn't be enough for what you need. And, even a basic fire rune requires a single small mana stone to sustain it for an hour"

"... So you're saying it's unsutainable?"

"Yes. Mana stones are not exactly cheap. You'd be burning gold after gold"

Josee fell into silence. Fredrich's words immediately erased many different plans she developed with runes in mind.

'... But to say it consumes a lot of mana stone', Josee lightly bit her lips, 'It's most likely an efficiency issues'

To a Mechanical Engineer like Josee, there was no such thing as magic, only hidden mechanisms waiting to be unlocked.

Therefore, Josee decided to take matters into her own hands for the time being.

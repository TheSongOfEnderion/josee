# Chapter 8

Three days passed.

Within the forest near aquel, a group of guards, a knight, and a woman in a yellow simple dress stood near a wooden shed. On the ground was a concrete brick with marks of hammering, but no signs of crack.

"What? How is this possible?", after smashing with a mallet, Schulga learned that the two bricks combined with concrete were inseparable. The once liquid rock was now as solid as any stone.

"Whoahh", the guards around them clapped in awe.

"Wait, if we have this. We won't even need to cut stones properly anymore!", the guard captain, Anthony smiled in awe.

"That's right", another guard noted, "Any stone will do and we can just fill it with this and it'll be just as strong!"

"Impressive", Schulga's eyes shook at the thought.

To create great buildings, one needs to hire masons who will cut stones into properly sized pieces that fits one another. This is specially time consuming and only a skilled mason can be trusted with cutting the stones. They will then need to use mortar to bind the stones together.

'That's the reason why walls, buildings, and houses are expensive to build', Schulga gulped.

'But this material. Cement. Doesn't this mean. We will have a new era of construction?''

From the side, Josee simply watched in silence. Wearing her simple yellow dress, she merely nodded. She turned to the side and saw two blocks made entirely of concerete.

"... Alright, enough dallying, Schulga, hit the two concrete blocks until it breaks", Josee ordered. She almost looked unimpressed and even annoyed.

Schulga nodded and took his mallet before slamming them repeatedly on the concrete block. After about five hits, the block started showing signs of cracking.

"... That's enough", Josee squat down and began examining the blocks.

'... Looks just about right. It's good i still remember the correct ratios', She turned towards Schulga and asked.

"... How did it feel?"

"Like hitting solid rock, milady", Schulga smiled.

"... Good", Josee stood up and folded her hands.

"Gather the carpenters and smith. And bring Friedrich to me"

◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

During her meeting with Friedrich, he explained about fire runes.

"My apologies, milady," Friedrich admitted. "Runes aren't my area of expertise. I can create a basic fire rune, but its heat wouldn't be enough for what you need. And, even a basic fire rune requires a single small mana stone to sustain it for an hour"

"... So you're saying it's unsutainable?"

"Yes. Mana stones are not exactly cheap. You'd be burning gold after gold"

'... Hmm... then I can't use fire runes for my kiln anytime soon'

Josee fell into silence. Fredrich's words immediately erased many different plans she developed with runes in mind.

'... But to say it consumes a lot of mana stone', Josee lightly bit her thumbnail, 'It's most likely an efficiency issue'

To a Mechanical Engineer like Josee, there was no such thing as magic, only hidden mechanisms waiting to be understood. A machine that needs to disassembled and reassembled to fully understand its workings.

Therefore, Josee decided to take matters into her own hands for the time being.

After dismissing Friedrich, Josee took out her journal and begun writing in the to-dos of her growing list.

'... I'm going to have to unlock the true nature of magic one day. But that's a low priority for now'

Josee placed her journal aside and took a large parchment out from the barrel besides her. It was similarly also filled with many rolled up parchment from Josee's constant drafting.

The draft revealed  small pipeline with two check valves next to each other. The first checkvalve was a little bit higher than the other. Next to the two checkvalve was a cylinder about a meter  high. From the looks of it, this small arrangement were designed to be placed between points of flowing water.

Josee then turned around and opened a chest by her side. Looking around the room, it was filled with many wood or metal of strange sizes.

Pulling out an object from the chest, Josee took out a device made of metal that looks exactly like the drawing.

After 3 days of crafting and repeated trial and error, Josee finally got the correct ratios to cause a good waterflow within the ram pump.

'... The cinder flames sure is convenient. I can just reshape the hot metal like clay'

However, Josee noticed the rusting on the metals.

'... Damn. I should have Friedrich teach me lightning magic. Then i'll be able to galvanize this'

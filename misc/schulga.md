Schulga has been the sole knight of the Kalingrad Barony. Ever since the previous old knight died, he has taken to himself to protect the family that sheltered and protected him.

He still remembered when he was just a wandering 18 years old. Exiled and thrown away by the "family" he had known in his life, he wandered many kingdoms and lands. He once had great ambitions, to obtain great power and eventually go back to his former family and prove to them that they were wrong in abandoning him.

But the mistress of fate proved ruthless. In spite of his excellent swordsmanship, no amount of training made him reach the level of an Aura Knight. Even the oldest in his family reach that level when they were fifteen.

And so, he spent his time as a mercenary, and sometimes as an adventurer. Daring that lands in search for an opportunity to gain power. But no such opportunity came.

One day, he was hired by a certain wealthy merchant to guard their caravan. It was going well, and he got along with the other mercenaries. It was just the usual trip, Schulga thought. Guard the caravan, kill the bandits that try, and collect his pay.

But this time, something else happened.

They were ambushed by an unknown group of assailants, bearing the mark of the twin moons. He fought desperately with his life, using every technique and weapons in his arsenal. But all proved fatal when he realized none of it worked. Heavily injured, he realized everyone was all but dead. He didn't know how he survived that long, but he learned that their goal was the girl inside the carriage.

Schulga cursed his life. All the humiliation, all the pain, all the misery brought onto him purely because he lacked the talents.

But suddenly, someone saved him. It was a young man, probably no older than ten.

And he was a Master Aura Knight.

With swift attacks, he instantly killed most of the unknown assailants and saved their lives. As Schulga watched with awe, the ambitions of the young 19-year-old was finally laid to rest.

Ever since then, Schulga simply wondered day to day. No longer willing to do any mercenary work, he found nothing but futility at his own lack of talents.

Until one day, as he starved at the streets, a couple had found him. The young baron Kalingrad and his late wife, carrying their fiver years old daughter. With great compassion, they took him and nursed him to health. They were unlike other nobles who only cared about their selfish wants. The couple loved and cared for the people and in turn, they too were loved by them. 

Touched by their noble hearts, that although they were meager, they did the best with what they had. And so Schulga made a decision, his journey had ended and this is where he will stay.

And ever since 12 years ago, he became the Kalingrad's family knight.

But something changed...

For one day, the beloved daughter of his master fell into a coma...

And woke up no longer herself.

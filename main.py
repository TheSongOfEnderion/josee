After dealing with a few affairs in the territory, Josee stepped into the barrack training grounds and begun her morning routine of training with Schulga.
"My lady", Schulga lightly asked. His wooden sword deflected Josee's blade with ease.
"You entered the Cursed Forest last night again didn't' you?", Schulga frowned with worry as he took a step back and dodged Josee's sword.
"... I did", josee heavily struck schulga's sword, causing his hands to shake.
'She grew stronger', Schulga assessed.
"I know you can heal your wounds",  quickly, schulga pushed Josee's blade and took a step back.
"But please. Don't be too reckless. I have read the family records, and there are monsters capable of destroying entire cities deep within the forest", Schulga remembered those text. At first, he could not believe them, but over the years, the things he had seen come out of the Cursed Forest made him believe there truly were horrors beyond his understanding.
"... You don't need to worry", Josee attacked again, holding her sword with both hands.
"... I know my limits"
After their morning routine, Josee took another bath before going to the kiln built near the outskirts of the village on the rocky mountain.
Wearing leather pants and a sleeveless shirt that Josee personally cut, Josee stood proudly with her brown hair tied in a ponytail.
Behind her was Schulga and some four guards.
Surrounded by trees, a shed was temporarily made, and inside were sacks of limestone that Josee asked the village workers to find for her.
"... Well. Now i have a solution for the housing problem"
"Milady", Schulga squat before the limestone sacks inside the small shed 
"What do we need these cave stones for", Schulga wondered. He had always seen these as dangerous stones formed in caves. You never knew when they'd fall and if they did, it could kill even the most veteran of warriors.
"...You'll see", Josee continued.
"... Tie the sacks then use the mallets to break the stones to pieces", after ordering them, they began crushing the limestones to tiny pieces. Josee herself took a mallet and began crushing them.
And to their surprise, a single hit from Josee made the ground crack and almost burst the sack. Even she didn't realize how strong she's become.
"Milady", Schulga wryly smiled, "You truly are going stronger everyday"
After half an hour of pulverizing the limestones, Josee ordered them to drop a few sacks inside the kiln.
"... Stay back, this will be hot", Josee raised her right hand before the kiln. Thr kiln burned bright from the intense heat that Josee released. It was so hot that he guards and Schulga took a hundred steps back to not get caught by the heat.
In the mean time, Misha and a few servants from the mansion arrived, carrying carts of food and drinks. The guards were immediately elated as the food soup even contained dried meat from Josee's last hunt.
An hour passed and Schulga and the rest kept waiting until they noticed Josee stop her flames.
"... Done", Josee stared at the kiln and saw the red hot limestone. The smoke released was a bit unbearable and luckily, Josee could control the flame, forcing hot air to push the smoke away
'... To create primitive cement, a high temperature is needed for calcination of limestone. Once the carbon dioxide is driven off, you're left with calcium oxide. Also known as quicklime'
Josee stepped towards the kiln before picking up a red hot stone. Seeing this, the guards flinched.
Schulga however, knew she was immune to heat. Still, it made him uncomfortable seeing someone touch something searing hot.
After.holding the stone in Josee's hand, it immediately crumbled to dust.
'... Might have overdone the heat a bit, but that looks just fine to me'
Josee repeated the same steps until she had approximately ten sacks of quicklime
Taking the water from a bucket and a few cups of sand from a sack, Schulga began mixing the mixture with quicklime. 
"... Remember to always wear a mask when dealing with quicklime and never to directly touch it. Theyre harmful to your health"
Josee reminded them. The guards, hearing this, nodded their head profusely.
After that's done, Josee asked Schulga to connect two bricks together using the primitive cement mixture.
Satiesfied with its look, Josee lightly smiled.
"Milady, will this really make this brick combine?"
"... Yes. It's called cement. Leave it inside the shed and tomorrow it''ll cure and harden"
But as Josee said this, her mind began forming plans.
'I can't do this myself all the time. Therefore i need a fuel source. Coal? Hmmm... These lands aren't rich in coal. Maybe i can import oil from the eastern dessert. Wait, magic is readily accessible. Fire runes can definitely solve the problem but it requires mana stone'
'But. I know a way to gather a LOT of mana stone. It wouldn't be an issue. Therefore, i just need to find a runic master'
"... Schulga, when will this friend of yours respond?"
"Oh. You mean Bolli. He should receive the letter by tomorrow. He still owe me therefore he definitely will not ignore it"
".... Good"

The cold north is a land of unforgiving nature, where Life could barely live.
Amidst the cold storm and the foggy hailing land laid a majestic, iron fortress. Standing aloft,ight shined within. The fortress was built, facing something it guards against.
And that something was a giant wall, a kilometer long, towering five hundred meters tall.
Armies stood in front of the Wall. Hundreds of thousands of men, each wearing cold armor,.ready to battle to the death.
Amongst this was a beautiful woman dressed in golden armor seating on a gold armoured knight horse. A battle maiden wielding an axe behind her back.
As the snowy fog hailed upon them, a man dressed in dark armor approached her in a horse.
"Lady Celine", the man places his right hand across his chest, lightly bowing in respect to the beautiful woman.
She lightly opened her eyes, revealing blue eyes as pure as the ocean.
"The forces are ready", the man reported, "The Talimor Archfamily has arrived and already positioned themselves"
"As tardy as always", the woman cruelly replied.
She stared forward unto the giant walls. In its center lies a titanic door, one that only a titan could have opened.
Suddenly, a banging sound occured. The ground shook, and the earth shivered, as jf a great horror was about to come.
"How many soldiers will we lose this round?", the man in a dark armor sighed.
"My Lady", he turned to her to ask. "Are we really not going to implore the center kingdoms? They have lived long and ignorant of the plight of our world. If not for us, they would all be run over by horrors"
"Its useless", Celine replied, "They are too far from the north, and the ridge separating us is too wide a gap for any sensible logistics to pass"
"Still", she continued, "our old ways of keeping this horror to ourselves are failing"
The wall shook once again, each banging sending shivers down the spine of every men and women.
"My lady", the man in dark armor spoke.
"The Magus Tower...", Celine started, "have discovered the ancient teleportation spell. Soon, the central and southern continent can no longer seat idly"
A maddening flash appeared in her eyes.
"They too, must burn like us"
The banging reached such a strong point that some of the people began falling to the ground. Celine took a sword from her hips, and a ray of Gold shined upon the battlefield.
The armies, each carrying a banner of a different household or kingdom all stared in her direction. As the commander and forefront of this battle, Celine became like a beacon of hope.
With a reverberating tremor she shouted.
"Today, we will fight for the Survival of our world. Today, we die so that the children of our future will inherit a world devoid of horrors. We wil fight, down to the last man!"
Pointing her sword forward, a group of mages near the walls began chanting their spells. And with great pressure, the titanic door fitted at the collosal walls finally opened.
"RARGGHHHHH!!!", A fifteen meter tall monster monster bearing terrible fangs and collosal wings came out of the gate. Behind it were smaller monsters, each ravaged by bloodlust and murder.
"Release the traps!", Celine shouted.
And a long winded battle occured, a war of attrition that claimed the life of many young soldiers and great warriors.
But for the future of this world, no price was too high to pay.
And that price, will be paid in full.

Josee didn't think that Schulga's friend would arrive this quick.
A man with a scrawny hair, a jacket of dark rose color and a cheap dark brown leather pants. Underneath his jacket was a white long sleeve and a small bow tie.
"Good afternoon milady. I am Bolli of the West Wing Merchant Company"
Schulga stood besides him. Observing his friend he hasn't seen in years, somehow, Schulga sported an iffy look
"... Hmmm", Josee lightly tapped the office table. Wearing her usual and simple red dress, Josee observed Bolli.
"... My name is Josephine Kalingrad of the Kalingrad Barony. Anyway, let's skip the formalities. You sure came here fast"
Josee calculated that it should have taken atleast 3 days for him to come from the capital city to aquel by boat.
But for some reason, he arrived a day earlier, and with a ship strawn and filled with damages.
'... In other words, he used a wind stone to speedup his travel'
"Well. I heard a great opportunity from my good friend Schulga. He's an excellent knight and with a honest character, i truly believe him. Hahahaha-"
"... You're in debt aren't you?", Josee rolled her eyes from the fake flattery.
"Ahh. What makes you think that milady", cold sweat fell from his back.
"... Look", Josee replied with sharp, cold eyes "Neither you nor me are mentally brain damaged. The faster you get honest, the quicker we can make a deal"
"Hahaha. Schulga, your lady sure makes an impression"
Schulga on the other hand merely shook his head ans sighed.
"I apologize my lady. I knew this guy was a total whore, but he was a competent merchant. Now though", Schulga looked him with a pitying frown.
"H-Hey Schulga. I didn't mean for it to happen. That vile woman got me in debt!", frantically, he exclaimed in frustration.
As josee saw this, she shook her head.
"... This won't do. I can't make a deal with a guy like this"
"W-Wait my lady!"

**Urorian Royal Family** - The Royal Family of Brytoria. Each member who has been inducted by the Blessing of the Golden Star posses great power. A lot of the members of the Urorian Family are powerful warriors and mages who ruled their kingdom. For hundreds of years, the Urorian Royal Family remained unbested in their territory and treated with almost godlike veneration. 

1. King Harald Uroria
2. 1st Prince Jerald Uroria
3. General Nagard Uroria 
4. Knight Aswald Uroria
5. Archmage Elanoir Uroria

The King of the Urorian Royal family is careful with treating his nobles and other powerful forces in his country as he knew well of the history of Golden Star lineage. It was not, in anyway, a single lineage but a broken chain of families after families usurping one another.

**The Order of the Golden Star** - is an order dedicated to the Golden Star as mandated by its Will Incarnate. The Royal family, the **Urorian**, are the current ruling family chosen by the Golden star.

Although the Urorian claims they are an unbroken chain of lineage, they are in fact not. There have been multiple royal families throughout the Golden Star Order, each falling from grace and replaced by another. The Urorian simply kept a propaganda to instill a history to themselves.

The Golden Star is contained inside a monolithic golden pillar situated behind the Royal Palace.

The blessing of the Golden Star to its Royal Family is that it grants them great strength, great magic potential, future seeing eyes, and stores their body's internal organsa and blood inside the Golden Star, effectively making them immune to any and all physical  damage. The downside is that despite their power, all recipient of the Golden Star ages normally.

**Golden Inquisitor** - The Golden Inquistor is a group under the Order of the Golden Star which exists to destroy and all heretics trying to subvert the state of Brytoria.

**Worship**
The Brytorians Worship the Urorian Royal Family as the embodiment of the Goddess Persephone's Golden Star. This focus on her veneration

# The Birth of a Hero

Ethan Morales is a smart and confident kid with a rather chaotic personality. Like any other kid, he too wanted to become a Hero. But his wish changed into something sinister after an accident a year ago. When after killing his five mentors, a monster forced him to choose which of his two friends he had to sacrifice. Emboldened by his thirst to take back what was stolen, Ethan enrolled into UHA, one of the Greatest Hero Academy in the world.

Despite his great performance at the Entrance Exam, Ethan found himself landing in the worst section, E-Class. A class populated by students with unique traits and insane behaviors. A class seemingly so strange the school separated them from the student body in their own isolated mountain.

But Ethan did not enroll in this school to become a Heroâ€¦ but to prepare for the day when he will brutally murder the monster that stole from him.
